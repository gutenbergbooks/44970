<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>As some apology would seem to be necessary
for the effort, herewith made, to add yet
one more volume to the already overcrowded
shelf containing the Nation's literature of the
great Civil War, it may be well to say a few
words in explanation of the following pages.</p>

<p>Several years ago the writer prepared a
brief series of papers for the columns of <cite>St.
Nicholas</cite>, under the title of "Recollections of
a Drummer-Boy." It was thought that these
sketches of army life, as seen by a boy, would
prove enjoyable and profitable to children in
general, and especially to the children of the
men who participated in the great Civil War,
on one side or the other; while the belief was
entertained that they might at the same time
serve to revive in the minds of the veterans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
themselves long-forgotten or but imperfectly
remembered scenes and experiences in camp
and field. In the outstart it was not the
author's design to write a connected story,
but rather simply to prepare a few brief and
hasty sketches of army life, drawn from his
own personal experience, and suitable for
magazine purposes. But these, though prepared
in such intervals as could with difficulty
be spared from the exacting duties of a
busy professional life, having been so kindly
received by the editors of <cite>St. Nicholas</cite>, as
well as by the very large circle of the readers
of that excellent magazine, and the writer
having been urgently pressed on all sides for
more of the same kind, it was thought well
to revise and enlarge the "Recollections of a
Drummer-Boy," and to present them to the
public in permanent book form. In the shape
of a more or less connected story of army
life, covering the whole period of a soldier's
experience from enlistment to muster-out,
and carried forward through all the stirring
scenes of camp and field, it was believed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
these "Recollections," in the revised form,
would commend themselves not only to the
children of the soldiers of the late war, but
to the surviving soldiers themselves; while
at the same time they would possess a reasonable
interest for the general reader as well.</p>

<p>From first to last it has been the author's
design, while endeavoring faithfully to reflect
the spirit of the army to which he belonged,
to avoid all needless references of a sectional
nature, and to present to the public a story of
army life which should breathe in every page
of it the noble sentiment of "malice towards
none, and charity for all."</p>

<p>In all essential regards, the following pages
are what they profess to be,&mdash;the author's
personal recollections of three years of army
life in active service in the field. In a few
instances, it is true, certain incidents have
been introduced which did not properly fall
within the range of the writer's personal
experience; but these have been admitted
merely as by the way, or for the sake of being
true to the spirit rather than to the letter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Facts and dates have been given as accurately
as the author's memory, aided by a
carefully kept army journal, would permit;
while the names of officers and men mentioned
in the narrative are given as they
appear in the published muster-rolls, with
the exception of several instances, easily recognized
by the intelligent reader, in which,
for evident reasons, it seemed best to conceal
the actors beneath fictitious names.
While speaking of the matter of names, an
affectionate esteem for a faithful boyhood's
friend and subsequent army messmate constrains
the writer to mention that, as
"Andy" was the name by which Fisher
Gutelius, "high private in the rear rank,"
was commonly known while wearing the
blue, it has been deemed well to allow him
to appear in the narrative under cover of
this, his army <em>sobriquet</em>.</p>

<p>As no full and complete history of the One
Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment Pennsylvania
Volunteers has ever yet been written, it is
hoped that these Recollections of one of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
humblest members may serve the purpose of
recalling to the minds of surviving comrades
the stirring scenes through which they passed,
as well as of keeping alive in coming time
the name and memory of an organization
which deserved well of its country during
the ever-memorable days of now more than
twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The author herewith acknowledges his indebtedness
for certain facts to a brief sketch
of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment
Pennsylvania Volunteers by Thomas Chamberlain,
late Major of the same; and to John
C. Kensill, late sergeant of Company F, for
valuable information; and to the editors of
<cite>St. Nicholas</cite> for their uniform courtesy and
encouragement.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to interest the reader to
know that the illustrations signed A. C. R.
were drawn by Allen C. Redwood, who served
in the Confederate army, and witnessed, albeit
from the other side of the fence, many of the
scenes which his graphic pencil has so admirably
depicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
With these few words of apology and explanation,
the author herewith places <span class="smcap">The
Recollections of a Drummer-Boy</span> in the
hands of a patient and ever-indulgent public.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="medium">OFF TO THE WAR.</span></h2>

<p>"It is no use, Andy, I cannot study any
more. I have struggled against this feeling,
and have again and again resolved to shut
myself up to my books and stop thinking
about the war; but when news comes of one
great battle after another, and I look around
in the school-room and see the many vacant
seats once occupied by the older boys, and
think of where they are and what they may
be doing away down in Dixie, I fall to day-dreaming
and wool-gathering over my books,
and it is just no use. I cannot study any
more. I might as well leave school and go
home and get at something else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
But my companion was apparently too deeply
interested in unravelling the intricacies of a
sentence in Cæsar to pay much attention to
what I had been saying. For Andy was a
studious boy, and the sentence with which he
had been wrestling when the bell rang for
recess could not at once be given up. He had
therefore carried his book with him on our
walk as we strolled leisurely up the green lane
which led past the "Old Academy," and, with
his copy of Cæsar spread out before him, lay
stretched out at full length on the greensward,
in the shade of a large cherry-tree,
whose fruit was already turning red under the
warm spring sun. It was a beautiful, dreamy
day in May, early in the summer of 1862, the
second year of the great Civil War. The air
was laden with the sweet scent of the young
clover, and vocal with the song of the robin
and the bluebird. The sky was cloudless overhead,
and the soft spring breeze blew balmily
up from the south. Behind us were the hills,
covered with orchards, and beneath us lay the
quiet little village of M&mdash;&mdash;, with its one
thousand inhabitants, and beyond it the valley,
renowned far and wide for its beauty, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
in the farther background deep-blue mountains
rose towering toward the sky.</p>

<p>My companion, apparently quite indifferent
to the languid influence of the season, resolutely
persevered at his task until he had triumphantly
mastered it. Then, closing the
book and clasping his hands behind his head
as he rolled around on his back, he looked at
me with a smile and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! you only have the spring-fever,
Harry."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, Andy; it was the same
last winter. And don't you remember how
excited <em>you</em> were when the news came about
Fort Sumter last spring? You would have
enlisted right off, had your father consented.
Or, may be, <em>you</em> had the spring-fever then?"</p>

<p>"I'm all over that now, and for good and
all. I want to study, and as I cannot study
and keep on thinking of the war all the time,
why I just stop thinking about the war as
well as I can."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I cannot. Look at our
school: why, there are scarcely any large
boys left in it any more, only little fellows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and the girls. For my part, I ought to get at
something else."</p>

<p>"What would you get at? You would feel
the same anywhere else. There is Ike Zellers,
the blacksmith, for example. When I came
past his shop this morning on my way to
school, instead of being busy with hammer
and tongs as he should have been, there he
was, sitting on an old harrow outside his
shop-door whittling a stick, while Elias Foust
was reading an account of the last battle from
some newspaper. I shouldn't wonder if Elias
and Ike both would be enlisting some one of
these days. It is the same everywhere. All
people feel the excitement of the war&mdash;storekeepers,
tradesmen, farmers, and even the
women; and we school-boys are no exception."</p>

<p>"Would you enlist, Andy, if your father
would consent? You are old enough."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should, Harry. I want to
stick to study. But there is no telling what
a person may do when he is once taken down
with this war-fever. But you are too young
to enlist; they wouldn't take you. And you
had therefore better make up your mind to
stick to school and help me at my Cæsar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
If you want war, there's enough of it in old
Julius here to satisfy the most bloodthirsty,
I should think."</p>

<p>"You will find more about war, and of
a more romantic kind too, in Virgil and
Homer when you get on so far in your studies,
Andy. But the wars of Cæsar and the siege
of Troy, what are they when compared with
the great war now being waged in our own
time and country? The nodding plumes of
Hector and the shining armor of all old
Homer's heroes do not seem to me half so
interesting or magnificent as the brave uniforms
in which some of our older school-fellows
occasionally come home on furlough."</p>

<p>"Up there on the hillside," said Andy,
suddenly rising from his reclining posture,
"is cousin Joe Gutelius, hoeing corn in his
father's lot. Let's go up and see what he
has to say about the war."</p>

<p>We found Joe busy and hard at work with
the young corn. He was a fine young fellow,
perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three years of
age, tall, well built, of a fine manly bearing,
and looked a likely subject for a recruiting-officer,
as, in response to our loud "Hello,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Joe!" he left his unfinished row and came
down to the fence for a talk.</p>

<p>"Rather a warm day for work in a cornfield,
isn't it, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Joe, as he threw down
his hoe and mounted the top rail, wiping away
the perspiration, which stood in great beads
on his brow. "But I believe I'd rather hoe
corn than go to school such beautiful weather.
Nearly kill me to be penned up in the old
Academy such a day as this."</p>

<p>"That's what's the matter with Harry,
here," said Andy. "He's got the spring-fever,
I tell him; but he thinks he has the
war-fever. I told him we'd come up here
and see what you had to say about it."</p>

<p>"About what? About the spring-fever, or
about the war?"</p>

<p>"Why, about the war, of course, Joe," said
Andy with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I know what the war-fever is
like. I had a touch of it last winter when
the Fifty-first boys went off, and I came
very near going along with them, too. But
my brothers, Charlie and Sam, both wanted
to go, and I declared that if they went I'd go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
too; and mother took it so much to heart that
we all had to give it up. Charlie and Sam
came near joining a cavalry company some
months ago, and I shouldn't wonder much if
they did get off one of these days; but as
for myself, I guess I'll have to stay at home
and take care of the old folks."</p>

<p>"And I tell Harry, here," said Andy, "that
he had better stick to books and help me with
my Cæsar."</p>

<p>"Or he might get a hoe and come and help
me with my corn," said Joe, with a smile;
"that would take both the spring-fever and
the war-fever out of him in a jiffy. But there
is your bell calling you to your books. Poor
fellows, how I pity you!"</p>

<p>That my companion would persevere in his
purpose of "sticking to books," as he called
it, I had no doubt. For besides being naturally
possessed of a resolute will, he was
several years my senior, and therefore presumably
less liable to be carried away by the
prevailing restlessness of the times. But for
myself study continued to grow more and
more irksome as the summer drew on apace,
so that when, before the close of the term, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
former schoolmate began to "raise a company,"
as it was called, for the nine months'
service, unable any longer to endure my restless
longing for a change, I sat down at my
desk one day in the school-room and wrote
the following letter home:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="smcap">Dear Papa</span>: I write to ask whether I may
have your permission to enlist. I find the
school is fast breaking up; most of the boys
are gone. I can't study any more. <em>Won't</em>
you let me go?</p>

<p>Poor father! In the anguish of his heart
it must have been that he sat down and wrote:
"You may go!" Without the loss of a moment
I was off to the recruiting-office, showed
my father's letter, and asked to be sworn in.
But alas! I was only sixteen, and lacked two
years of being old enough, and they would not
take me unless I could swear I was eighteen,
which, of course, I could not and would not do.</p>

<p>So, then, back again to the school when the
fall term opened early in August, 1862, there
to dream over Horace, and Homer, and that
one poor little old siege of Troy, for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
days more, while Andy at my side toiled manfully
at his Cæsar. The term had scarcely
well opened, when, unfortunately for my peace
of mind, a gentleman who had been my school-teacher
some years previously, began to raise
a company for the war, and the village at once
went into another whirl of excitement, which
carried me utterly away; for they said I could
enlist as a drummer-boy, no matter how
young I might be, provided I had my father's
consent. But this, most unfortunately, had
been meanwhile revoked. For, to say nothing
of certain remonstrances on the part of
my father during the vacation, there had recently
come a letter saying,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="smcap">My dear Boy</span>: If you have not yet enlisted,
do not do so; for I think you are quite too
young and delicate, and I gave my permission
perhaps too hastily, and without due consideration.</p>

<p>But alas! dear father, it was too late then,
for I had set my very heart on going. The
company was nearly full, and would leave in
a few days, and everybody in the village knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
that Harry was going for a drummer-boy.
Besides, the very evening on which the above
letter reached me we had a grand procession
which marched all through the village street
from end to end, and this was followed by
an immense mass-meeting, and our future
captain, Henry W. Crotzer, made a stirring
speech, and the band played, and the people
cheered and cheered again, as man after man
stepped up and put his name down on the list.
Albert Foster and Joe Ruhl and Sam Ruhl
signed their names, and then Jimmy Lucas
and Elias Foust and Ike Zellers and several
others followed; and when Charlie Gutelius
and his brother Sam stepped up, with Joe at
their heels declaring that "if they went he'd
go too," the meeting fairly went wild with excitement,
and the people cheered and cheered
again, and the band played "Hail Columbia!"
and the "Star-Spangled Banner," and "Away
Down South in Dixie," and&mdash;in short, what
in the world was a poor boy to do?</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>There was an immense crowd of people at
the depot that midsummer morning, more
than twenty years ago, when our company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
started off to the war. It seemed as if the whole
county had suspended work and voted itself a
holiday, for a continuous stream of people, old
and young, poured out of the little village of
L&mdash;&mdash;, and made its way through the bridge
across the river, and over the dusty road beyond,
to the station where we were to take the train.</p>

<p>The thirteen of us who had come down
from the village of M&mdash;&mdash; to join the larger
body of the company at L&mdash;&mdash;, had enjoyed
something of a triumphal progress on the
way. We had a brass band to start with,
besides no inconsiderable escort of vehicles
and mounted horsemen, the number of which
was steadily swelled to quite a procession as
we advanced. The band played, and the flags
waved, and the boys cheered, and the people
at work in the fields cheered back, and the
young farmers rode down the lanes on their
horses, or brought their sweethearts in their
carriages, and fell in line with the dusty procession.
Even the old gatekeeper, who could
not leave his post, became much excited as we
passed, gave "three cheers for the Union forever,"
and stood waving his hat after us till
we were hid from sight behind the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Reaching L&mdash;&mdash; about nine in the morning,
we found the village all ablaze with bunting,
and so wrought up with the excitement that
all thought of work had evidently been given
up for that day. As we formed in line and
marched down the main street toward the
river, the sidewalks were everywhere crowded
with people,&mdash;with boys who wore red-white-and-blue
neckties, and boys who wore fatigue-caps;
with girls who carried flags, and girls
who carried flowers; with women who waved
their kerchiefs, and old men who waved their
walking-sticks; while here and there, as we
passed along, at windows and doorways, were
faces red with long weeping, for Johnny was
off to the war, and maybe mother and sisters
and sweetheart would never, never see him
again.</p>

<div><a name="the_company_starts_for_the_war" id="the_company_starts_for_the_war"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i027.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">The Company starts for the War.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Drawn up in line before the station, we
awaited the train. There was scarcely a
man, woman, or child in that great crowd
around us but had to press up for a last
shake of the hand, a last good by, and a
last "God bless you, boys!" And so, amid
cheering, and hand-shaking, and flag-waving,
and band-playing, the train at last came thundering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
in, and we were off, with the "Star-Spangled
Banner" sounding fainter and farther
away, until it was drowned and lost to the
ear in the noise of the swiftly rushing train.</p>

<p>For myself, however, the last good by had
not yet been said, for I had been away from
home at school, and was to leave the train at
a way station some miles down the road, and
walk out to my home in the country, and say
good by to the folks at home; and that was
the hardest part of it all, for good by then
might be good by forever.</p>

<p>If anybody at home had been looking out
of door or window that hot August afternoon,
more than twenty years ago, he would have
seen, coming down the dusty road, a slender
lad, with a bundle slung over his shoulder,
and&mdash;but nobody <em>was</em> looking down the road,
nobody was in sight. Even Rollo, the dog,
my old playfellow, was asleep somewhere in
the shade, and all was sultry, hot, and still.
Leaping lightly over the fence by the spring
at the foot of the hill, I took a cool draught
of water, and looked up at the great red farmhouse
above with a throbbing heart, for that
was home, and many a sad good by had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
there to be said, and said again, before I could
get off to the war!</p>

<p>Long years have passed since then, but
never have I forgotten how pale the faces
of mother and sisters became when, entering
the room where they were at work, and throwing
off my bundle, in reply to their question,
"Why, Harry! where did <em>you</em> come from?"
I answered, "I come from school, and I'm
off for the war!" You may well believe
there was an exciting time of it in the dining-room
of that old red farmhouse then. In the
midst of the excitement, father came in from
the field and greeted me with, "Why, my
boy, where did <em>you</em> come from?" to which
there was but the one answer, "Come from
school, and off for the war!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I can't let you go! I thought
you had given up all idea of that. What
would they do with a mere boy like you?
Why, you'd be only a bill of expense to the
Government. Dreadful thing to make me all
this trouble!"</p>

<p>But I began to reason full stoutly with
poor father. I reminded him, first of all,
that I would not go without his consent; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
in two years, and perhaps in less, I might be
drafted and sent amongst men unknown to
me, while here was a company commanded
by my own school-teacher, and composed of
acquaintances who would look after me; that
I was unfit for study or work while this fever
was on me, and so on; till I saw his resolution
begin to give way, as he lit his pipe and
walked down to the spring to think the matter
over.</p>

<p>"If Harry is to go, father," mother says,
"hadn't I better run up to the store and get
some woollens, and we'll make the boy an outfit
of shirts to-night yet?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes; I guess you had better do
so."</p>

<p>But when he sees mother stepping past the
gate on her way, he halts her with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop! That boy can't go! I <em>can't</em> give
him up!"</p>

<p>And shortly after, he tells her that she
"had better be after getting that woollen stuff
for shirts;" and again he stops her at the
gate with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dreadful boy! Why <em>will</em> he make me all
this trouble? I <em>can not</em> let my boy go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
But at last, and somehow, mother gets off.
The sewing-machine is going most of the
night, and my thoughts are as busy as it is,
until far into the morning, with all that is
before me that I have never seen, and all that
is behind me that I may never see again.</p>

<p>Let me pass over the trying good by the
next morning, for Joe is ready with the carriage
to take father and me to the station,
and we are soon on the cars, steaming away
toward the great camp, whither the company
already has gone.</p>

<p>"See, Harry, there is your camp!" And
looking out of the car-window, across the river,
I catch, through the tall tree tops, as we rush
along, glimpses of my first camp,&mdash;acres and
acres of canvas, stretching away into the dim
and dusty distance, occupied, as I shall soon
find, by some ten or twenty thousand soldiers,
coming and going continually, marching and
countermarching, until they have ground the
soil into the driest and deepest dust I ever
saw.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first impressions of
camp life as father and I passed the sentry at
the gate. They were anything but pleasant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and I could not but agree with the remark of
my father, that "the life of a soldier must be
a hard life indeed." For as we entered that
great camp, I looked into an A tent, the
front flap of which was thrown back, and saw
enough to make me sick of the housekeeping
of a soldier. There was nothing in that tent
but dirt and disorder, pans and kettles, tin
cups and cracker-boxes, forks and bayonet-scabbards,
greasy pork and broken hard-tack
in utter confusion, and over all and everywhere
that insufferable dust. Afterward,
when we got into the field, our camps in
summer-time were models of cleanliness, and
in winter models of comfort, as far, at least,
as axe and broom could make them so; but
this, the first camp I ever saw, was so abominable,
that I have often wondered it did
not frighten the fever out of me.</p>

<p>But once among the men of the company,
all this was soon forgotten. We had supper,&mdash;hard-tack
and soft bread, boiled pork and
strong coffee (in tin cups),&mdash;fare that father
thought "one could live on right well, I
guess;" and then the boys came around and
begged father to let me go; "they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
take care of Harry; never you fear for
that;" and so helped on my cause, that
that night, about eleven o'clock, when we
were in the railroad station together, on the
way home, father said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Harry, my boy, you are not enlisted
yet. I am going home on this train; you
can go home with me now, or go with the
boys. Which will you do?"</p>

<p>To which the answer came quickly enough,&mdash;too
quickly and too eagerly, I have often
since thought, for a father's heart to bear it
well,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa, I'll go with the boys!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, good by, my boy! And may
God bless you and bring you safely back to
me again!"</p>

<p>The whistle blew "Off brakes!" the car-door
closed on father, and I did not see him
again for three long, long years!</p>

<p>Often and often as I have thought over
these things since, I have never been able to
come to any other conclusion than this: that
it was the "war-fever" that carried me off,
and that made poor father let me go. For
that "war-fever" was a terrible malady in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
those days. Once you were taken with it,
you had a very fire in the bones until your
name was down on the enlistment-roll. There
was Andy, for example, my schoolfellow, and
afterward my messmate for three ever-memorable
years. I have had no time to tell you
how Andy came to be with us; but with us
he surely was, notwithstanding he had so
stoutly asserted his determination to quit
thinking about the war and stick to his
books.</p>

<p>He was on his way to school the very
morning the company was leaving the village,
with no idea of going along; but seeing
this, that, and the other acquaintance in line,
what did he do but run across the street to
an undertaker's shop, cram his school-books
through the broken window, take his place in
line, and march off with the boys without so
much as saying good by to the folks at
home! And he did not see his Cæsar and
Greek grammar again for three years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="medium">FIRST DAYS IN CAMP.</span></h2>

<p>Our first camp was located on the outskirts
of Harrisburg, Pa., and was called "Camp Curtin."
It was so named in honor of Governor
Andrew G. Curtin, the "War Governor" of
the State of Pennsylvania, who was regarded
by the soldiers of his State with a patriotic enthusiasm
second only to that with which they,
in common with all the troops of the Northern
States, greeted the name of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Camp Curtin was not properly a camp of
instruction. It was rather a mere rendezvous
for the different companies which had been
recruited in various parts of the State. Hither
the volunteers came by hundreds and thousands
for the purpose of being mustered into
the service, uniformed and equipped, assigned
to regiments, and shipped to the front as rapidly
as possible. Only they who witnessed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
can form any idea of the patriotic ardor,
amounting often to a wild enthusiasm, with
which volunteering went on in those days.
Companies were often formed, and their muster-rolls
filled, in a week, sometimes in a few
days. The contagion of enlisting and "going
to the war" was in the very atmosphere.
You could scarcely accompany a friend to a
way station on any of the main lines of travel,
without seeing the future wearers of blue
coats at the car-windows and on the platforms.
Very frequently whole trains were filled with
them, speeding away to the State capital as
swift as steam could carry them. They poured
into Harrisburg, company by company, usually
in citizens' clothes, and marched out of the
town a week or so later, regiment by regiment,
all glorious in bright new uniforms and glistening
bayonets, transformed in a few days
from citizens into soldiers, and destined for
deeds of high endeavor on many a bloody
field.</p>

<p>Shortly after our arrival in camp, Andy and
I went to town to purchase such articles as we
supposed a soldier would be likely to need,&mdash;a
gum-blanket, a journal, a combination knife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
fork, and spoon, and so on to the end of the
list. To our credit I have it to record that we
turned a deaf ear to the solicitations of a certain
dealer in cutlery who insisted on selling
us each a revolver, and an ugly looking bowie-knife
in a bright red morocco sheath.</p>

<p>"Shentlemens, shust de ting you vill need
ven you goes into de battle. Ah, see dis
knife, how it shines! Look at dis very fine
revolfer!"</p>

<p>But Moses entreated in vain, while his wife
stood at the shop-door looking at some regiment
marching down the street to the depot,
weeping as if her heart would break, and wiping
her eyes with the corner of her apron from
time to time.</p>

<p>"Ah, de poor boys!" said she. "Dere dey
go again, off to de great war, away from deir
homes, and deir mutters, deir wives and deir
sweethearts, all to be kilt in de battle! Dey
will nefer any more coom back. Oh, it is so
wicked!"</p>

<p>But the drums rattled on, and the crowd on
the sidewalk gazed and cheered, and Moses
behind his counter smiled pleasantly as he
cried up his wares and went on selling bowie-knives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
and revolvers to kill men with, while
his wife went on weeping and lamenting because
men would be killed in the wicked war,
and "nefer any more coom back." The firm
of Moses and wife struck us as a very strange
combination of business and sentiment. I do
not know how many knives and pistols Moses
sold, nor how many tears his good wife shed,
but if she wept whenever a regiment marched
down the street to the depot, her eyes must
have been turned into a river of tears; for the
tap of the drum and the tramp of the men
resounded along the streets of the capital by
day and by night, until people grew so used to
it that they scarcely noticed it any more.</p>

<p>The tide of volunteering was at the full
during those early fall days of 1862. But the
day came at length when the tide began to
turn. Various expedients were then resorted
to for the purpose of stimulating the flagging
zeal of Pennsylvania's sons. At first the
tempting bait of large bounties was presented&mdash;county
bounties, city bounties, State and
United States bounties&mdash;some men towards
the close of the war receiving as much as one
thousand dollars, and never smelling powder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
at that. At last drafting was of necessity
resorted to, and along with drafting came all
the miseries of "hiring substitutes," and so
making merchandise of a service of which it
is the chief glory that it shall be free.</p>

<p>But in the fall of '62 there had been no
drafting yet, and large bounties were unknown&mdash;and
unsought. Most of us were taken quite
by surprise when, a few days after our arrival
in camp, we were told that the County Commissioners
had come down for the purpose of paying
us each the magnificent sum of fifty dollars.
At the same time, also, we learned that
the United States Government would pay us
each one hundred dollars additional, of which,
however, only twenty-five were placed in our
hands at once. The remaining seventy-five
were to be received only by those who might
safely pass through all the unknown dangers
which awaited us, and live to be mustered out
with the regiment three years later.</p>

<p>Well, it was no matter then. What cared
we for bounty? It seemed a questionable
procedure, at all events, this offering of money
as a reward for an act which, to be a worthy
act at all, asks not and needs not the guerdon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of gold. We were all so anxious to enter the
service, that, instead of looking for any artificial
helps in that direction, our only concern
was lest we might be rejected by the examining
surgeon and not be admitted to the ranks.</p>

<p>For soon after our arrival, and before we
were mustered into the service, every man was
thoroughly examined by a medical officer, who
had us presented to him one by one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in puris
naturalibus</i>, in a large tent, where he sharply
questioned us&mdash;"Teeth sound? Eyes good?
Ever had this, that, and the other disease?"&mdash;and
pitiable was the case of that unfortunate
man who, because of bad hearing, or defective
eyesight, or some other physical blemish, was
compelled to don his citizen's clothes again
and take the next train for home.</p>

<p>After having been thoroughly examined, we
were mustered into the service. We were all
drawn up in line. Every man raised his right
hand while an officer recited the oath. It
took only a few minutes, but when it was over
one of the boys exclaimed: "Now, fellows, I'd
like to see any man go home if he dare. We
belong to Uncle Sam now."</p>

<p>Of the one thousand men drawn up in line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
there that day, some lived to come back three
years later and be drawn up in line again,
almost on that identical spot, for the purpose
of being mustered out of the service. And
how many do you think there were? Not
more than one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>As we now belonged to Uncle Sam, it was
to be expected that he would next proceed to
clothe us. This he punctually did a few days
after the muster. We had no little merriment
when we were called out and formed in
line and marched up to the quartermaster's
department at one side of the camp to draw
our uniforms. There were so many men to
be uniformed, and so little time in which to do
it, that the blue clothes were passed out to us
almost regardless of the size and weight of
the prospective wearer. Each man received
a pair of pantaloons, a coat, cap, overcoat,
shoes, blanket, and underwear, of which latter
the shirt was&mdash;well, a revelation to most of
us both as to size and shape and material. It
was so rough, that no living mortal, probably,
could wear it, except perhaps one who wished
to do penance by wearing a hair shirt. Mine
was promptly sent home along with my citizen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
clothes, with the request that it be kept
as a sort of heir-loom in the family for future
generations to wonder at.</p>

<p>With our clothes on our arms, we marched
back to our tents, and there proceeded to get
on the inside of our new uniforms. The result
was in most cases astonishing! For, as
might have been expected, scarcely one man
in ten was fitted. The tall men had invariably
received the short pantaloons, and presented
an appearance, when they emerged
from their tents, which was equalled only by
that of the short men who had, of course, received
the long pantaloons. One man's cap
was perched away up on the top of his head,
while another's rested on his ears. Andy,
who was not very tall, waddled forth into the
company street amid shouts of laughter, having
his pantaloons turned up some six inches
or more from the bottoms, declaring that
"Uncle Sam must have got the patterns for
his boys' pantaloons somewhere over in
France; for he seems to have cut them after
the style of the two French towns, Toulon
and Toulouse."</p>

<p>"Hello, fellows! what do you think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
this? Now just look here, will you!" exclaimed
Pointer Donachy, the tallest man in
the company, as he came out of his tent in a
pair of pantaloons that were little more than
knee-breeches for him, and began to parade
the street with a tent-pole for a musket.
"How in the name of the American eagle is
a man going to fight the battles of his country
in such a uniform as this? Seems to me
that Uncle Sam must be a little short of cloth,
boys."</p>

<p>"Brother Jonathan generally dresses in
tights, you know," said some one.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Andy, "Pointer's uniform reminds
one of what the poet says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"'Man needs but little here below,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Nor needs that little long.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"You're rather poor at quoting poetry,
Andy," answered Pointer, "because I need
more than a little here below: I need at least
six inches."</p>

<p>But the shoes! Coarse, broad-soled, low-heeled
"gunboats," as we afterward learned
to call them&mdash;what a time there was getting
into them. Here came one fellow down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
street with shoes so big that they could
scarcely be kept on his feet, while over yonder
another tugged and pulled and kicked
himself red in the face over a pair that <em>would</em>
not go on. But by trading off, the large men
gradually got the large garments and the little
men the small, so that in a few days we
were all pretty well suited.</p>

<p>I remember hearing about one poor fellow
in another company, a great strapping six-footer,
who could not be suited. The largest
shoe furnished by the Government was quite
too small. The giant tried his best to force
his foot in, but in vain. His comrades gathered
about him, and laughed, and chaffed him
unmercifully, whereupon he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, you don't think they are all <em>boys</em>
that come to the army, do you? A man like
me needs a man's shoe, not a baby's."</p>

<p>There was another poor fellow, a very
small man, who had received a very large
pair of shoes, and had not yet been able to
effect any exchange. One day the sergeant
was drilling the company on the facings&mdash;Right-face,
Left-face, Right-about-face&mdash;and
of course watched his men's feet closely, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
see that they went through the movements
promptly. Observing one pair of feet down
the line that never budged at the command,
the sergeant, with drawn sword, rushed up
to the possessor of them, and in menacing
tones demanded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you mean by not facing about
when I tell you? I'll have you put in the
guard-house, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;did, sergeant," said the trembling
recruit.</p>

<p>"You did not, sir. Didn't I watch your
feet? They never moved an inch."</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said the man, "my shoes
are so big that they don't turn when I do.
I go through the motions on the inside of
them!"</p>

<p>Although Camp Curtin was not so much a
camp of instruction as a camp of equipment,
yet once we had received our arms and uniforms,
we were all eager to be put on drill.
Even before we had received our uniforms,
every evening we had some little drilling
under command of Sergeant Cummings, who
had been out in the three months' service.
Clothed in citizens' dress and armed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
such sticks and poles as we could pick up, we
must have presented a sorry appearance on
parade. Perhaps the most comical figure in
the line was that of old Simon Malehorn, who,
clothed in a long linen duster, high silk hat,
blue overalls, and loose slippers, was forever
throwing the line into confusion by breaking
rank and running back to find his slipper,
which he had lost in the dust somewhere, and
happy was he if some one of the boys had not
quietly smuggled it into his pocket or under
his coat, and left poor Simon to finish the
parade in his stocking-feet.</p>

<p>Awkward enough in the drill we all were,
to be sure. Still, we were not quite so stupid
as a certain recruit of whom it was related
that the drill sergeant had to take him aside
as an "awkward squad" by himself, and try
to teach him how to "mark time." But
alas! the poor fellow did not know his right
foot from his left, and consequently could not
follow the order, "Left! Left!" until the sergeant,
driven almost to desperation, lit on the
happy expedient of tying a wisp of straw on
one foot and a similar wisp of hay on the
other, and then put the command in a somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
agricultural shape&mdash;"Hay-foot, Straw-foot!
Hay-foot, Straw-foot!" whereupon it
is said he did quite well; for if he did not
know his left foot from his right, he at least
could tell hay from straw.</p>

<p>One good effect of our having been detained
in Camp Curtin for several weeks was that
we thus had the opportunity of forming the
acquaintance of the other nine companies,
with which we were to be joined in one common
regimental organization. Some of these
came from the western and some from the
eastern part of the State; some were from the
city, some from inland towns and small villages,
and some from the wild lumber regions.
Every rank, class, and profession seemed to be
represented. There were clerks, farmers, students,
railroad men, iron-workers, lumbermen.
At first we were all strangers to one another.
The different companies, having as yet no
regimental life to bind them together as a
unit, naturally regarded each other as foreigners
rather than as members of the same organization.
In consequence of this, there was
no little rivalry between company and company,
together with no end of friendly chaffing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and lively banter, especially about the time
of roll-call in the evening. The names of the
men who hailed from the west were quite
strange, and a long-standing source of amusement
to the boys from the east, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>.
When the Orderly-Sergeant of Company I
called the roll, the men of Company B would
pick out all the outlandish-sounding surnames
and make all manner of puns on them, only
to be paid back in their own coin by similar
criticisms of <em>their</em> roll. Then there were
certain forms of expression peculiar to the
different sections from which the men came,
strange idiomatic usages of speech, amounting
at times to the most pronounced provincialisms,
which were a long-continued source
of merriment. Thus the Philadelphia boys
made all sport of the boys from the upper tier
of counties because they said "I be going
deown to teown," and invariably used "I make
out to" for "I am going to," or "I intend
to." Some of the men, it was observed, called
every species of board, no matter how thin,
"a plank;" and every kind of stone, no
matter how small, "a rock." How the men
laughed one evening when a high wind came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
up and blew the dust in dense clouds all over
the camp, and one of the western boys was
heard to declare that he had "a rock in his
eye!"</p>

<p>Once we got afield, however, there was developed
such a feeling of regimental unity as
soon obliterated whatever natural antagonisms
may at first have existed between the different
companies. Peculiarities of speech of
course remained, and a generous and wholesome
rivalry never disappeared; but these
were a help rather than a hindrance. For in
military, as in all social life, there can be no
true unity without some diversity in the component
parts,&mdash;a principle which is fully
recognized in our national motto, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E pluribus
unum</i>."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="medium">ON TO WASHINGTON.</span></h2>

<p>After two weeks in that miserable camp
at the State capital, we were ordered to Washington;
and into Washington, accordingly,
one sultry September morning, we marched,
after a day and a night in the cars on the
way thither. Quite proud we felt, you may
be sure, as we tramped up Pennsylvania Avenue,
with our new silk flags flying, the fifes
playing "Dixie," and we ten little drummer-boys
pounding away, awkwardly enough, no
doubt, under the lead of a white-haired old
man, who had beaten <em>his</em> drum, nearly fifty
years before, under Wellington, at the battle
of Waterloo. We were green, raw troops, as
anybody could tell at a glance; for we were
fair-faced yet, and carried enormous knapsacks.
I remember passing some old troops
somewhere near Fourteenth Street, and being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
painfully conscious of the difference between
them and us. <em>They</em>, I observed, had no
knapsacks; a gum-blanket, twisted into a
roll, and slung carelessly over the shoulder,
was all the luggage they carried. Dark,
swarthy, sinewy men they were, with torn
shoes and faded uniforms, but with an air
of self-possession and endurance that came
only of experience and hardship. They smiled
on us as we passed by,&mdash;a grim smile of half
pity and half contempt,&mdash;just as we in our
turn learned to smile on other new troops a
year or two later.</p>

<p>By some unpardonable mistake, instead of
getting into camp forthwith on the outskirts
of the city, whither we had been ordered for
duty at the present, we were marched far out
into the country, under a merciless sun, that
soon scorched all the endurance out of me.
It was dusty; it was hot; there was no water;
my knapsack weighed a ton. So that when,
after marching some seven miles, our orders
were countermanded, and we faced about to
return to the city again, I thought it impossible
I ever should reach it. My feet moved
mechanically, everything along the road was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
in a misty whirl; and when at nightfall Andy
helped me into the barracks near the Capitol
from which we had started in the morning, I
threw myself, or rather perhaps fell, on the
hard floor, and was soon so soundly asleep
that Andy could not rouse me for my cup of
coffee and ration of bread.</p>

<p>I have an indistinct recollection of being
taken away next morning in an ambulance
to some hospital, and being put into a clean
white cot. After which, for days, all consciousness
left me, and all was blank before
me, save only that, in misty intervals, I saw
the kind faces and heard the subdued voices
of Sisters of Mercy,&mdash;voices that spoke to
me from far away, and hands that reached
out to me from the other side of an impassable
gulf.</p>

<p>Nursed by their tender care back to returning
strength, no sooner was I able to stand
on my feet once more than, against their
solemn protest, I asked for my knapsack and
drum, and insisted on setting out forthwith
in quest of my regiment, which I found had
meanwhile been scattered by companies about
the city, my own company and another having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
been assigned to duty at "Soldiers' Home,"
the President's summer residence. Although
it was but a distance of three miles or thereabouts,
and although I started out in search
of "Soldiers' Home" at noon, so conflicting
were the directions given me by the various
persons of whom I asked the road, that it
was nightfall before I reached it. Coming
then at the hour of dusk to a gateway leading
apparently into some park or pleasure-ground,
and being informed by the porter at the gate
that this was "Soldiers' Home," I walked
about among the trees, in the growing darkness,
in search of the camp of Company D,
when, just as I had crossed a fence, a challenge
rang out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"A friend."</p>

<p>"Advance, friend, and give the countersign!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Elias!" said I, peering through
the bushes, "is that you?"</p>

<p>"That isn't the countersign, friend. You'd
better give the countersign, or you're a dead
man!"</p>

<p>Saying which, Elias sprang back in true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Zouave style, with his bayonet fixed and
ready for a lunge at me.</p>

<p>"Now, Elias," said I, "you know me just
as well as I know myself, and you know I
haven't the countersign; and if you're going
to kill me, why, don't stand there crouching
like a cat ready to spring on a mouse, but up
and at it like a man. Don't keep me here in
such dreadful suspense."</p>

<p>"Well, friend without the countersign, I'll
call up the corporal, and he may kill you,&mdash;you're
a dead man, any way!" Then he
sang out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, post number
three!"</p>

<p>From post to post it rang along the line,
now shrill and high, now deep and low: "Corporal
of the guard, post number three!" "Corporal
of the guard, post number three!"</p>

<p>Upon which up comes the corporal of the
guard on a full trot, with his gun at a right-shoulder
shift, and saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what's up?"</p>

<p>"Man trying to break my guard."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Why there, beside that bush."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
"Come along, you there; you'll be shot for
a spy to-morrow morning at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Corporal, I'm ready."</p>

<p>Now all this was fine sport; for Corporal
Harter and Elias were both of my company,
and knew me quite as well as I knew them;
but they were bent on having a little fun at
my expense, and the corporal had marched
me off some distance toward headquarters,
beyond the ravine, when again the call rang
along the line,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, post number
three!" "Corporal of the guard, post number
three!"</p>

<p>Back the corporal trotted me to Elias.</p>

<p>"Well, what in the mischief's up now?"</p>

<p>"Another fellow trying to break my guard,
corporal."</p>

<p>"Well, where is he? Trot him out! We'll
have a grand execution in the morning! The
more the merrier, you know; and 'Long live
the Union!'"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, corporal, but the fact is I killed
this chap myself. I caught him trying to
climb over the gate there, and he wouldn't
stop nor give the countersign, and so I up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and at him, and ran my bayonet through him,
and there he is!"</p>

<p>And sure enough, there he was,&mdash;a big
fat 'possum!</p>

<p>"All right, Elias; you're a brave soldier.
I'll speak to the colonel about this, and you
shall have two stripes on your sleeve one of
these days."</p>

<p>And so, with the 'possum by the tail and me
by the shoulder, he marched us off to headquarters,
where, the 'possum being thrown
down on the ground, and I handed over to
the tender mercies of the captain, it was
ordered that&mdash;</p>

<p>"This young man should be taken down to
Andy's tent, and a supper cooked, and a bed
made for him there; and that henceforth and
hereafter he should beat reveille at daybreak,
retreat at sundown, tattoo at nine p.m., and
lights out a half-hour later."</p>

<p>Nothing, however, was said about the execution
of spies in the morning, although it
was duly ordained that the 'possum, poor
thing, should be roasted for dinner the next
day.</p>

<p>Never was there a more pleasant camp than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
ours,&mdash;there on that green hillside across
the ravine from the President's summer residence.
We had light guard duty to do, and
that of a kind we esteemed a most high
honor; for it was no less than that of being
special guards for President Lincoln. But
the good President, we were told, although
he loved his soldiers as his own children, did
not like being guarded. Often did I see him
enter his carriage before the hour appointed
for his morning departure for the White
House, and drive away in haste, as if to
escape from the irksome escort of a dozen
cavalry-men, whose duty it was to guard
his carriage between our camp and the city.
Then when the escort rode up to the door,
some ten or fifteen minutes later, and found
that the carriage had already gone, wasn't
there a clattering of hoofs and a rattling of
scabbards as they dashed out past the gate
and down the road to overtake the great and
good President, in whose heart was "charity
for all, and malice toward none!"</p>

<p>Boy as I was, I could not but notice how
pale and haggard the President looked as
he entered his carriage in the morning, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
stepped down from it in the evening, after
a weary day's work in the city; and no wonder,
either, for those September days of 1862
were the dark, perhaps the darkest, days of
the war. Many a mark of favor and kindness
did we receive from the President's family.
Delicacies, such as we were strangers to then,
and would be for a long time to come, found
their way from Mrs. Lincoln's hand to our
camp on the green hillside; while little Tad,
the President's son, was a great favorite with
the boys, fond of the camp, and delighted
with the drill.</p>

<p>One night, when all but the guards on their
posts were wrapped in great-coats and sound
asleep in the tents, I felt some one shake me
roughly by the shoulder, and call:</p>

<p>"Harry! Harry! Get up quick and beat
the long roll; we're going to be attacked.
Quick, now!"</p>

<p>Groping about in the dark for my drum and
sticks, I stepped out into the company street,
and beat the loud alarm, which, waking the
echoes, brought the boys out of their tents in
double-quick time, and set the whole camp in
an uproar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
"What's up, fellows?"</p>

<p>"Fall in, Company D!" shouted the orderly.</p>

<p>"Fall in, men," shouted the captain; "we're
going to be attacked at once!"</p>

<p>Amid the confusion of so sudden a summons
at midnight, there was some lively
scrambling for guns, bayonets, cartridge-boxes,
and clothes.</p>

<p>"I say, Bill, you've got my coat on!"</p>

<p>"Where's my cap?"</p>

<p>"Andy, you scamp, you've got my shoes!"</p>

<p>"Fall in, men, quick; no time to look after
shoes now. Take your arms and fall in."</p>

<p>And so, some shoeless, others hatless, and
all only half dressed, we formed in line and
marched out and down the road at double-quick
for a mile; then halted; pickets were
thrown out; an advance of the whole line
through the woods was made among tangled
bushes and briers, and through marshes, until,
as the first early streaks of dawn were shooting
up in the eastern sky, our orders were
countermanded, and we marched back to
camp, to find&mdash;that the whole thing was a
ruse, planned by some of the officers for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
purpose of testing our readiness for work
at any hour. After that, we slept with our
shoes on.</p>

<p>But poor old Peter Blank,&mdash;a man who
should never have enlisted, for he was as
afraid of a gun as Robinson Crusoe's man
Friday,&mdash;poor old Peter was the butt for
many a joke the next day. For amid the
night's confusion, and in the immediate prospect,
as he supposed, of a deadly encounter
with the enemy, so alarmed did he become
that he at once fell to&mdash;praying! Out of
consideration for his years and piety, the captain
had permitted him to remain behind as a
guard for the camp in our absence, in which
capacity he did excellent service, excellent
service! But oh, when we sat about our fires
the next morning, frying our steaks and cooking
our coffee, poor Peter was the butt of all
the fun, and was cruelly described by the wag
of the company as "the man that had a brave
heart, but a most cowardly pair of legs!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="medium">OUR FIRST WINTER QUARTERS.</span></h2>

<p>"Well, fellows, I tell you what! I've
heard a good deal about the balmy breezes
and sunny skies of Old Virginny, but if this
is a specimen of the sort of weather they have
in these parts, I, for one, move we 'right-about-face'
and march home."</p>

<p>So saying, Phil Hammer got up from under
the scrub-pine, where he had made his bed for
the night, shaking the snow from his blanket
and the cape of his overcoat, while a loud
"Ha! ha!" and an oft-repeated "What do
you think of this, boys?" rang along the hillside
on which we had found our first camping-place
on "Old Virginia's Shore."</p>

<p>The weather had played us a most deceptive
and unpleasant trick. We had landed
the day before, as my journal says, "at Belle
Plains, at a place called Platt's Landing,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
having been brought down from Washington
on the steamer "Louisiana;" had marched
some three or four miles inland in the direction
of Falmouth, and had halted and camped
for the night in a thick undergrowth of scrub-pine
and cedar. The day of our landing was
remarkably fair. The skies were so bright,
the air was so soft and balmy, that we were
rejoiced to find what a pleasant country it was
we were getting into, to be sure; but the next
morning, when we drummer-boys woke the
men with our loud reveille, we were all of
Phil's opinion, that the sunny skies and balmy
breezes of this new land were all a miserable
fiction. For as man after man opened his
eyes at the loud roll of our drums, and the
shout of the orderly: "Fall in, Company D,
for roll-call!" he found himself covered with
four inches of snow, and more coming down.
Fortunately, the bushes had afforded us some
protection; they were so numerous and so
thick that one could scarcely see twenty rods
ahead of him, and with their great overhanging
branches had kindly kept the falling snow
out of our faces, at least while we slept.</p>

<div><a name="in_winter_quarters" id="in_winter_quarters"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i062.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">In Winter-Quarters.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>And now began a busy time. We were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
build winter quarters&mdash;a work for which we
were but poorly prepared, either by nature or
by circumstance. Take any body of men out
of civilized life, put them into the woods to
shift for themselves, and they are generally
as helpless as children. As for ourselves, we
were indeed "Babes in the Wood." At least
half the regiment knew nothing of wood-craft,
having never been accustomed to the use of
the axe. It was a laughable sight to see some
of the men from the city try to cut down a
tree! Besides, we were poorly equipped.
Axes were scarce, and worth almost their
weight in gold. We had no "shelter-tents."
Most of us had "poncho" blankets; that is
to say, a piece of oilcloth about five feet by
four, with a slit in the middle. But we found
our ponchos very poor coverings for our
cabins; for the rain just <em>would</em> run down
through that unfortunate hole in the middle;
and then, too, the men needed their oilcloths
when they went on picket, for which purpose
they had been particularly intended. This
circumstance gave rise to frequent discussion
that day: whether to use the poncho as a
covering for the cabin, and get soaked on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
picket, or to save the poncho for picket, and
cover the cabin with brushwood and clay?
Some messes<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> chose the one alternative,
others the other; and as the result of this
preference, together with our ignorance of
wood-craft and the scarcity of axes, we produced
on that hillside the oddest looking
winter quarters a regiment ever built! Such
an agglomeration of cabins was never seen
before nor since. I am positive no two cabins
on all that hillside had the slightest resemblance
to each other.</p>

<p>There, for instance, was a mess over in
Company A, composed of men from the city.
They had <em>one</em> kind of cabin, an immense
square structure of pine-logs, about seven feet
high, and covered over the top, first with
brushwood, and then coated so heavily with
clay that I am certain the roof must have
been two feet thick at the least. It was hardly
finished before some wag had nicknamed it
"Fortress Monroe."</p>

<p>Then there was Ike Zellers, of our own
company; he invented another style of architecture,
or perhaps I should rather say he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
borrowed it from the Indians. Ike would
have none of your flat-roofed concerns; he
would build a wigwam. And so, marking out
a huge circle, in the centre of which he erected
a pole, and around the pole a great number of
smaller poles, with one end on the circle and
the other end meeting in the common apex,
covering this with brush, and the brush with
clay, he made for himself a house that was
quite warm, indeed, but one so fearfully
gloomy, that within it was as dark at noon
as at midnight. Ominous sounds came afterward
from the dark recesses of "The Wigwam;"
for we were a "skirmish regiment,"
and Ike was our bugler, and the way he tooted
all day long, "Deploy to the right and left,"
"Rally by fours," and "Rally by platoons,"
was suggestive of things yet to come.</p>

<p>Then there was my own tent, or cabin, if
indeed I may dignify it with the name of
either; for it was a cross between a house and
a cave. Andy and I thought we would follow
the advice of the Irishman, who, in order to
raise his roof higher, dug his cellar deeper.
We resolved to dig down some three feet;
"and then, Harry, we'll log her up about two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
feet high, cover her with ponchos, and we'll
have the finest cabin in the row!" It took us
about three days to accomplish so stupendous
an undertaking, during which time we slept at
night under the bushes as best we could, and
when our work was done, we moved in with
great satisfaction. I remember the door of
our house was a mystery to all visitors, as,
indeed, it was to ourselves until we "got the
hang of it," as Andy said. It was a hole about
two feet square, cut through one end of the log
part of the cabin, and through it you had to
crawl as best you could. If you put one leg
in first, then the head, and then drew in the
other leg after you, you were all right; but if,
as visitors generally did, you put in your head
first, you were obliged to crawl in on all fours
in a most ungraceful and undignified fashion.</p>

<p>That was a queer-looking camp all through.
If you went up to the top of the hill, where the
Colonel had his quarters, and looked down, a
strange sight met your eyes. By the time the
next winter came, however, we had learned
how to swing an axe, and we built ourselves
winter quarters that reflected no little credit
on our skill as experienced woodsmen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
last cabin we built&mdash;it was down in front of
Petersburg&mdash;was a model of comfort and
convenience: ten feet long by six wide and
five high, made of clean pine-logs straight as
an arrow, and covered with shelter tents; a
chimney at one end, and a comfortable bunk
at the other; the inside walls covered with
clean oat-bags, and the gable ends papered
with pictures cut from illustrated papers;
a mantelpiece, a table, a stool; and we were
putting down a floor of pine-boards, too, one
day toward the close of winter, when the surgeon
came by, and, looking in, said:</p>

<p>"No time to drive nails now, boys; we have
orders to move!" But Andy said:</p>

<p>"Pound away, Harry, pound away; we'll
see how it looks, anyhow, before we go!"</p>

<p>I remember an amusing occurrence in connection
with the building of our winter quarters.
I had gone over to see some of the boys
of our company one evening, and found they
had "logged up" their tent about four feet
high, and stretched a poncho over it to keep
the snow out, and were sitting before a fire
they had built in a chimney-place at one end.
The chimney was built up only as high as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
log walls reached, the intention being to "cat-stick
and daub" it afterward to a sufficient
height. The mess had just got a box from
home, and some one had hung nearly two
yards of sausage on a stick across the top of
the chimney, "to smoke." And there, on a
log rolled up in front of the fire, I found
Jimmy Lucas and Sam Ruhl sitting smoking
their pipes, and glancing up the chimney between
whiffs every now and then, to see that
the sausage was safe. Sitting down between
them, I watched the cheery glow of the fire,
and we fell to talking, now about the jolly
times they were having at home at the holiday
season, and again about the progress of our
cabin-building, while every now and then
Jimmy would peep up the chimney on one
side, and shortly after Sam would squint up
on the other. After sitting thus for half an
hour or so, all of a sudden, Sam, looking up
the chimney, jumped off the log, clapped his
hands together, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Jim, it's <em>gone</em>!"</p>

<p>Gone it was; and you might as well look for
a needle in a haystack as search for two yards
of sausage among troops building winter quarters
on short rations!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
One evening Andy and I were going to have
a feast, consisting in the main of a huge dish
of apple-fritters. We bought the flour and the
apples of the sutler at enormous figures, for
we were so tired of the endless monotony of
bacon, beef, and bean-soup, that we were bent
on having a glorious supper, cost or no cost.
We had a rather small chimney-place, in
which Andy was superintending the heating
of a mess-pan half full of lard, while I was
busying myself with the flour, dough, and
apples, when, as ill-luck would have it, the
lard took fire and flamed up the chimney with
a roar and a blaze so bright that it illuminated
the whole camp from end to end. Unfortunately,
too, for us, four of our companies
had been recruited in the city, and most of
them had been in the volunteer fire department,
in which service they had gained an
experience, useful enough to them on the present
occasion, but most disastrous to us.</p>

<p>No sooner was the bright blaze seen pouring
high out of the chimney-top of our modest little
cabin, than at least a half-dozen fire companies
were on the instant organized for the emergency.
The "Humane," the "Fairmount," the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
"Good-will," with their imaginary engines and
hose-carriages, came dashing down our company
street with shouts, and yells, and cheers.
It was but the work of a moment to attach the
imaginary hose to imaginary plugs, plant
imaginary ladders, tear down the chimney
and demolish the roof, amid a flood of sparks,
and to the intense delight of the firemen, but
to our utter consternation and grief. It took
us days to repair the damage, and we went to
bed with some of our neighbors, after a scant
supper of hard-tack and coffee.</p>

<p>How did we spend our time in winter quarters,
do you ask? Well, there was always
enough to do, you may be sure, and often it
was work of the very hardest sort. Two days
in the week the regiment went out on picket,
and while there got but little sleep and suffered
much from exposure. When they were
not on picket, all the men not needed for camp
guard had to drill. It was nothing but drill,
drill, drill: company drill, regimental drill,
brigade drill, and once even division drill.
Our regiment, as I have said, was a skirmish
regiment, and the skirmish-drill is no light
work, let me tell you. Many an evening the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
men came in more dead than alive after skirmishing
over the country for miles around, all
the afternoon. Reveille and roll-call at five
o'clock in the morning, guard mount at nine,
company drill from ten to twelve, regimental
drill from two to four, dress-parade at five,
tattoo and lights out at nine at night, with
continual practice on the drum for us drummer-boys&mdash;so
our time passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="medium">A GRAND REVIEW.</span></h2>

<p>On a certain day near the beginning of
April, 1863, we were ordered to prepare for
a grand review of our corps. President Lincoln,
Mrs. Lincoln, Master Tad Lincoln (who
used to play among our tents at "Soldiers'
Home"), and some of the Cabinet officers,
were coming down to look us over and see
what promise we gave for the campaign soon
to open.</p>

<p>Those who have never seen a grand review
of well-drilled troops in the field have never
seen one of the finest and most inspiring
sights the eyes of man can behold. I wish I
could impart to my readers some faint idea of
the thrilling scene which must have presented
itself to the eyes of the beholders when, on
the morning of the ninth day of April, 1863,
our gallant First Army Corps, leaving its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
camps among the hills, assembled on a wide,
extended plain for the inspection of our illustrious
visitors.</p>

<p>As regiment after regiment, and brigade
after brigade, came marching out from the
surrounding hills and ravines, with flags gayly
flying, bands and drum corps making such
music as was enough to stir the blood in the
heart of the most indifferent to a quicker
pulse, and well-drilled troops that marched
in the morning sunlight with a step as steady
as the stroke of machinery,&mdash;ah! it was a
sight to be seen but once in a century! And
when those twenty thousand men were all at
last in line, with the artillery in position off
to one side on the hill, and ready to fire their
salute, it seemed well worth the President's
while to come all the way from Washington
to look at them.</p>

<div><a name="waiting_to_be_reviewed_by_the_president" id="waiting_to_be_reviewed_by_the_president"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i072.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Waiting to be reviewed by the President.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>But the President was a long, long time
in coming. The sun, mounting fast toward
noon, began to be insufferably hot. One hour,
two hours, three hours were passing away,
when, at last, far off through a defile between
the hills, we caught sight of a great cloud of
dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
"Fall in, men!" for now here they come,
sure enough. Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in a
carriage, escorted by a body of cavalry and
groups of officers, and at the head of the
cavalcade Master Tad, big with importance,
mounted on a pony, and having for his especial
escort a boy orderly, dressed in a cavalry-man's
uniform, and mounted on another pony!
And the two little fellows, scarce restraining
their boyish delight, outride the company,
and come on the field in a cloud of dust and
at a full gallop,&mdash;little Tad shouting to the
men, at the top of his voice: "Make way,
men! Make way, men! Father's a-coming!
Father's a-coming!"</p>

<p>Then the artillery breaks forth into a thundering
salute, that wakes the echoes among
the hills and sets the air to shivering and
quaking about your ears, as the cavalcade
gallops down the long line, and regimental
standards droop in greeting, and bands and
drum corps, one after another, strike up
"Hail to the Chief," till they are all playing
at once in a grand chorus that makes the
hills ring as they never rang before.</p>

<p>But all this is only a flourish by way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
prelude. The real beauty of the review is
yet to come, and can be seen only when the
cavalcade, having galloped down the line in
front and up again on the rear, has taken its
stand out yonder immediately in front of the
middle of the line, and the order is given to
"pass in review."</p>

<p>Notice now, how, by one swift and dexterous
movement, as the officers step out
and give the command, that long line is
broken into platoons of exactly equal length;
how, straight as an arrow, each platoon is
dressed; how the feet of the men all move
together, and their guns, flashing in the sun,
have the same inclination. Observe particularly
how, when they come to wheel off, there
is no <em>bend</em> in the line, but they wheel as if the
whole platoon were a ramrod made to revolve
about its one end through a quarter-circle;
and now that they are marching thus down
the field and past the President, what a grandeur
there is in the steady step and onward
sweep of that column of twenty thousand boys
in blue!</p>

<p>But once we have passed the President
and gained the other end of the field, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
not nearly so fine. For we must needs finish
the review in a double-quick, just by way of
showing, I suppose, what we could do if we
were wanted in a hurry,&mdash;as indeed we shall
be, not more than sixty days hence! Away
we go, then, on a dead run off the field, in a
cloud of dust and amid a clatter of bayonet-scabbards,
till, hid behind the hills, we come
to a more sober pace, and march into camp
just as tired as tired can be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="medium">ON PICKET ALONG THE RAPPAHANNOCK.</span></h2>

<p>"Harry, wouldn't you like to go out on
picket with us to-morrow? The weather is
pleasant, and I'd like to have you for company,
for time hangs rather heavy on a fellow's
hands out there; and, besides, I want
you to help me with my Latin."</p>

<p>Andy was a studious fellow, and carried
on his studies with greater or less regularity
during our whole time of service. Of course
we had no books, except a pocket copy of
"Cæsar;" but to make up for the deficiency,
particularly of a grammar, I had written out
the declensions of the nouns and the conjugations
of the verbs on odd scraps of paper,
which Andy had gathered up and carried in
a roll in his breast-pocket, and many were
the lessons we had together under the canvas
or beneath the sighing branches of the
pines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
"Well, old boy, I'd like to go along first-rate;
but we must get permission of the adjutant
first."</p>

<p>Having secured the adjutant's consent, and
provided myself with a gun and accoutrements,
the next morning, at four o'clock, I
set out, in company with a body of some
several hundred men of the regiment. We
were to be absent from camp for two days, at
the expiration of which time we were to be
relieved by the next detail.</p>

<p>It was pleasant April weather, for the
season was well advanced. Our route lay
straight over the hills and through the ravines,
for there were no roads, fences, nor
fields. But few houses were to be seen, and
from these the inhabitants had, of course,
long since disappeared. At one of these few
remaining houses, situated some three hundred
yards from the river's edge, our advance
picket-reserve was established, the captain in
command making his headquarters in the
once beautiful grounds of the mansion, long
since deserted and left empty by its former
occupants. The place had a very distressing
air of neglect. The beautiful lawn in front,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
where merry children had no doubt played
and romped in years gone by, was overgrown
with weeds. The large and commodious porch,
where in other days the family gathered in
the evening-time and talked and sang, while
the river flowed peacefully by, was now abandoned
to the spiders and their webs. The
whole house was pitifully forlorn looking, as
if wondering why the family did not come
back to fill its spacious halls with life and
mirth. Even the colored people had left their
quarters. There was not a soul anywhere
about.</p>

<p>We were not permitted either to enter the
house or to do any damage to the property.
Pitching our shelter-tents under the outspreading
branches of the great elms on
the lawn in front of the house, and building
our fires back of a hill in the rear to cook
our breakfast, we awaited our turn to stand
guard on the picket-line, which ran close
along the river's edge.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to my young readers
to know more particularly how this matter of
standing picket is arranged and conducted.
When a body of men numbering, let us say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
for the sake of example, two hundred in all,
go out on picket, the detail is usually divided
into two equal parts, consisting in the supposed
case of one hundred each. One of these
companies of a hundred goes into a sort of
camp about a half mile from the picket-line,&mdash;usually
in a woods or near by a spring, if
one can be found, or in some pleasant ravine
among the hills,&mdash;and the men have nothing
to do but make themselves comfortable for
the first twenty-four hours. They may sleep
as much as they like, or play at such games
as they please, only they must not go away
any considerable distance from the post, because
they may be very suddenly wanted, in
case of an attack on the advance picket-line.</p>

<p>The other band of one hundred takes position
only a short distance to the rear of the
line where the pickets pace to and fro on their
beats, and is known as the advance picket-post.
It is under the charge of a captain or
Lieutenant, and is divided into three parts,
each of which is called a "relief," the three
being known as the first, the second, and
the third relief, respectively. Each of these
is under the charge of a non-commissioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
officer,&mdash;a sergeant or corporal,&mdash;and must
stand guard in succession, two hours on and
four off, day and night, for the first twenty-four
hours, at the end of which time the
reserve one hundred in the rear march up
and relieve the whole advance picket-post,
which then goes to the rear, throws off its
accoutrements, stacks its arms, and sleeps till
it can sleep no more. I need hardly add that
each picket is furnished with the countersign,
which is regularly changed every day. While
on the advance picket-post no one is permitted
to sleep, whether on duty on the line or not,
and to sleep on the picket-line is death! At
or near midnight a body of officers, known as
"The Grand Rounds," goes all along the line,
examining every picket, to see that "all is
well."</p>

<p>Andy and I had by request been put together
on the second relief, and stood guard
from eight to ten in the morning, two to four
in the afternoon, and eight to ten and two to
four at night.</p>

<p>It was growing dark as we sat with our
backs against the old elms on the lawn,
telling stories, singing catches of songs, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
discussing the probabilities of the summer
campaign, when the call rang out: "Fall in,
second relief!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Harry&mdash;get on your horse-hide
and shooting-iron. We have a nice moonlight
night for it, any way."</p>

<p>Our line, as I have said, ran directly along
the river's edge, up and down which Andy
and I paced on our adjoining beats, each of
us having to walk about a hundred yards,
when we turned and walked back, with gun
loaded and capped and at a right-shoulder-shift.</p>

<p>The night was beautiful. A full round
moon shone out from among the fleecy clouds
overhead. At my feet was the pleasant plashing
of the river, ever gliding on, with the
moonbeams dancing as if in sport on its rippling
surface, while the opposite bank was hid
in the deep, solemn shadows made by the
overhanging trees. Yet the shadows were
not so deep there but that occasionally I could
catch glimpses of a picket silently pacing his
beat on the south side of the river, as I was
pacing mine on the north, with bayonet flashing
in the patches of moonlight as he passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
up and down. I fell to wondering, as I
watched him, what sort of man he was?
Young or old? Had he children at home,
may be, in the far-off South? Or a father
and mother? Did he wish this cruel war was
over? In the next fight may be he'd be
killed! Then I fell to wondering who had
lived in that house up yonder, and what kind of
people they were. Were the sons in the war?
And the daughters, where were they? and
would they ever come back again and set up
their household gods in the good old place
once more? My imagination was busy trying
to picture the scenes that had enlivened the
old plantation, the darkies at work in the
fields, and the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, Yank! We can lick you!"</p>

<p>"Beautiful night, Johnny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, lovely!"</p>

<p>But our orders are to hold as little conversation
with the pickets on the other side of
the river as necessary, and so, declining any
further civilities, I resume my beat.</p>

<p>"Harry, I'm going to lie down here at the
upper end of your beat," says the sergeant
who has charge of our relief. "I ain't a-going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
to sleep, but I'm tired. Every time you come
up to this end of your beat, speak to me, will
you? for I <em>might</em> fall asleep."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sergeant."</p>

<p>The first time I speak to him, the second,
and the third, he answers readily enough,
"All right, Harry;" but at the fourth summons
he is sound asleep. Sleep on, sergeant,
sleep on! Your slumbers shall not be broken
by me, unless the "Grand Rounds" come
along, for whom I must keep a sharp lookout,
lest they catch you napping and give you a
pretty court-martial! But Grand Rounds or
no, you shall have a little sleep. One of these
days you, and many more of us besides, will
sleep the last long sleep that knows no waking.
But hark! I hear the challenge up the
line! I must rouse you, after all.</p>

<p>"Sergeant! Sergeant! Get up&mdash;Grand
Rounds!"</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"The Grand Rounds."</p>

<p>"Advance, officer of the Grand Rounds,
and give the countersign."</p>

<p>An officer steps out from the group that is
half-hidden in the shadow, and whispers in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
my ear, "Lafayette," when the whole body
silently and stealthily passes down the line.</p>

<p>Relieved at ten o'clock, we go back to our
post at the house, and find it rather hard work
to keep our eyes open from ten to two o'clock,
but sleep is out of the question. At two
o'clock in the morning the second relief goes
out again, down through the patch of meadow,
wet with the heavy dew, and along down the
river to our posts. It is nearly three o'clock,
and Andy and I are standing talking in low
tones, he at the upper end of his beat and I at
the lower end of mine, when&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang! And the whistle of a ball is heard
overhead among the branches. Springing forward
at once by a common impulse, we get
behind the shelter of a tree, run out our rifles,
and make ready to fire.</p>

<p>"You watch up-river, Harry," whispers
Andy, "and I'll watch down; and if you see
him trying to handle his ramrod, let him have
it, and don't miss him."</p>

<div><a name="in_a_dangerous_part_of_his_beat" id="in_a_dangerous_part_of_his_beat"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i084.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">In a Dangerous Part of his Beat.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>But apparently Johnny is in no hurry to
load up again, and likes the deep shadow of
his tree too well to walk his beat any more,
for we wait impatiently for a long while and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
see nothing of him. By and by we hear him
calling over: "I say, Yank!"</p>

<p>"Well, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"If you won't shoot, I won't."</p>

<p>"Rather late in the morning to make such
an offer, isn't it? Didn't you shoot just
now?"</p>

<p>"You see, my old gun went off by accident."</p>

<p>"That's a likely yarn o' yours, Johnny!"</p>

<p>"But it's an honest fact, any way."</p>

<p>"Well, Johnny, next time your gun's going
to go off in that uncomfortable way, you will
oblige us chaps over here by holding the muzzle
down toward Dixie, or somebody'll turn
up his toes to the daisies before morning yet."</p>

<p>"All right, Yank," said Johnny, stepping
out from behind his tree into the bright moonlight
like a man, "but we can lick you, any
way!"</p>

<p>"Andy, do you think that fellow's gun went
off by accident, or was the rascal trying to
hurt somebody?"</p>

<p>"I think he's honest in what he says,
Harry. His gun might have gone off by accident.
There's no telling, though; he'll
need a little watching, I guess."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
But Johnny paces his beat harmlessly
enough for the remainder of the hour, singing
catches of song, and whistling the airs of
Dixie, while we pace ours as leisurely as he,
but, with a wholesome regard for guns that
go off so easily of themselves, we have a decided
preference for the dark shadows, and
are cautious lest we linger too long on those
parts of our several beats where the bright
moonbeams lie.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the sentries
of the two armies were forever picking one
another off whenever opportunity offered; for
what good did it do to murder each other in
cold blood? It only wasted powder, and did
not forward the issue of the great conflict at
all. Except at times immediately before or
after a battle, or when there was some specially
exciting reason for mutual defiance,
the pickets were generally on friendly terms,
conversed freely about the news of the day,
exchanged newspapers, coffee, and tobacco,
swapped knives, and occasionally had a
friendly game of cards together. Sometimes,
however, picket duty was but another name
for sharpshooting and bushwhacking of the
most dangerous and deadly sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
When we had been relieved, and got back
to our little bivouac under the elms on the
lawn, and sat down there to discuss the episode
of the night, I asked Andy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was that piece of poetry you read
to me the other day, about a picket being shot?
It was something about 'All quiet along the
Potomac to-night.' Do you remember the
words well enough to repeat it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I committed it to memory, Harry;
and if you wish, I'll recite it for your benefit.
We'll just imagine ourselves back in the dear
old Academy again, and that it is 'declamation-day,'
and my name is called, and I step
up and declaim:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center large">ALL QUIET ALONG THE POTOMAC<br />

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="medium">A MUD-MARCH AND A SHAM BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>We had been quietly lying in our winter
quarters there at Belle Plains some two
months and more, without having yet had
much to vary the dull monotony of a soldier's
everyday life. There was, of course, plenty
of work in the way of picket duty and endless
drilling, and no lack of fun in the camp of
one kind or other; but of all this we gradually
wearied, and began to long for something
new. Not that we were especially anxious
for the fatigues of the march and the stirring
scenes of the battle-field (of all which we were
so far blissfully ignorant): we simply felt
that we were tired of the monotony of camp
life, and, knowing that great things were
before us, with all the ardor of young men for
strange experiences and new adventures, we
gradually became more and more anxious for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the campaign to open. Alas! we knew not
what it was we wished for; for when this
celebrated campaign of '63 was ended, the
few of us who remained to build our second
winter quarters had seen quite enough of
marching and fighting to last us the rest of
our natural days.</p>

<p>However, it was with feelings of relief that
we suddenly received orders for the march
early in the afternoon of Monday, April 20.
As good luck would have it, Andy and I had
just finished a hearty meal consisting in the
main of apple-fritters; for by this time we
had repaired our chimney, which had been
destroyed by the fire, and had several times
already prepared our fritters without burning
our house down over our heads in the operation.
Having finished our meal, we were
lying lazily back against our knapsacks, disputing
as to whose turn it was to wash the
dishes, when Andy, hearing some outcry
which I had not noticed, suddenly leaped out
of the little door in the side of our cabin into
the company street, exclaiming as he did
so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that, sergeant? What's up?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
"Orders to move, that's all, my boy," said
the sergeant. "Orders to move. Pack up
immediately."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" queried a dozen
voices in chorus; for the news spread like
fire in a clearing, and the boys came tumbling
out of their cabins pell-mell and gathered
about the sergeant in a group.</p>

<p>"You tell me, and I'll tell you," answered
the sergeant, with a shrug of his shoulders,
as he shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pack up immediately, men! We go in
light marching order. No knapsacks; only a
shelter or a gum-blanket, and three days' rations
in your haversacks; and be lively now!"</p>

<p>It was not long before we were all ready,
with our thirty hard-tack, a piece of pork, and
a little coffee and sugar in our haversacks,
and our gum-blankets or shelters rolled and
twisted into a shape somewhat resembling an
immense horse-collar, slung over the shoulder
diagonally across the body, as was universally
the custom with the troops when knapsacks
were to be dispensed with in winter, or had
been thrown away in summer. We drummer-boys,
tightening our drums and tuning them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
up with a tap-tap-tap of the drumstick, took
station on the parade-ground up on the hill,
awaiting the adjutant's signal to beat the
assembly. At the first tap of our drums the
whole regiment, in full view below us, poured
out of quarters, like ants tumbling out of their
hill when disturbed by the thrust of a stick.
As the men fell into line and marched by companies
up the hill to the parade-ground where
the regiment was ordinarily formed, cheer upon
cheer went up; for the monotony of camp life
was now plainly at an end, and we were at last
to be up and doing, though where, or how, or
what, no one could tell.</p>

<p>When a drum-head is wet, it at once loses
all its peculiar charm and power. On the present
occasion our drum-heads were soon soaked,
for it was raining hard. So, unloosening the
ropes, we slung our useless sheepskins over
our shoulders, as the order was given, "Forward&mdash;route-step&mdash;march!"
The order
"route-step" was always a welcome and merciful
command, and the reader must bear in
mind that troops on the march always go by
the "route-step." They march usually four
abreast, indeed, but make no effort to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
step; for marching in that way, though good
enough for a mile or two on parade, would
soon become intolerable if kept up for any
great distance. In "route-step" each man
picks his way, selecting his steps at his pleasure,
and carrying or shifting his arms at his
convenience. Even then, marching is no easy
matter, especially when it is raining, and you
are marching over a clay soil,&mdash;and it did
seem to us that the soil about Belle Plains was
the toughest and most slippery clay in the
world, at least in the roads that wound, serpent-like,
around the hills amongst which we
were marching, where, as we well knew, many
a poor mule during the winter had stuck fast,
and had to be literally pulled out or left to die
in his tracks after the harness had been ripped
off his back.</p>

<p>At first, however, we had tolerable marching,
for we took across the fields, and kept well
upon the high ground as long as we could.
We passed some good farms and comfortable
looking houses, where we should have liked to
stop and buy bread and butter, or get "hoecake"
and milk; but there was no time for
that, for we made no halt longer than was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
necessary to allow the rear to "close up,"
and then were up and away again at a swift
pace.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on. Night set in, and
we began to wonder, in all the simplicity of
new troops, whether Uncle Sam expected us to
march all night as well as all day? To make
matters still worse, as night fell dark and drizzling,
we left the high ground and came out
on the main road of those regions; and if
we never before knew what Virginia mud was
like, we knew it then. It was not only knee-deep,
but also so sticky, that when you set one
foot down, you could scarcely pull the other
out. As for myself, I found my side-arms (if
indeed they merited the name) a provoking
incumbrance. Drummer-boys carried no arms
except a straight thin sword fastened to a broad
leathern belt about the waist. Of this we had
been in the outstart quite proud, and had kept it
polished with great care. However, this "toad-sticker,"
as we were pleased to call it, on this
mud-march caused each of us drummer-boys a
world of trouble, and well illustrated the saying
that "pride goeth before a fall." For as
we groped about in the darkness and slid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
plunged about in the mud, this miserable
sword was forever getting tangled up with the
wearer's legs, so that before he was aware of
it, down he went on his face in the mud. My
own weapon gave me so many falls that night,
that I was quite out of conceit with it. When
we reached camp after this march was done,
I handed it to the quartermaster, agreeing
to pay the price of it thrice over rather than
carry it any more. The rest of the drummer-boys,
I believe, carried theirs as far as Chancellorsville,
and there solemnly hung them up
on an oak-tree, where they are unto this day,
if nobody has found them and carried them
off as trophies of war.</p>

<p>We had a little darky along with us on this
march who had an experience which was quite
as provoking to him as it was amusing to us.
The darky's name was Bill. Other name he
had none, except "Shorty," which had been
given him by the boys because of his remarkably
short stature. For although he was as
strong as a man, and quite as old-featured, he
was nevertheless so dwarfed in size that the
name Shorty seemed to become him better than
his original name of Bill. Well, Shorty had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
been employed by one of our captains as cook,
or, as seemed more likely on the present occasion,
as a sort of sumpter-mule. For the captain,
having an eye to comfort on the march,
had loaded the poor darky with a pack of
blankets, tents, pans, kettles, and general camp
equipage, so large and bulky, that it is no exaggeration
to say that Shorty's pack was quite
as large as himself. All along it had been a
wonder to us how he had managed to pull
through so far with all that immense bundle
on his back; but, with strength far beyond his
size, he had trudged doggedly on at the captain's
heels, over hill and through field, until
we came at nightfall to the main road. There,
like many another sumpter-mule, he stuck fast
in the mud, so that, puff and pull as he might,
he could not pull either foot out, and had to
be dragged out by two men, to the great merriment
of all who in the growing darkness
were aware of Shorty's misfortune.</p>

<p>At length it became so dark that no one
was able to see an inch before his face, and we
lost the road. Torches were then lighted, in
order to find it. Then we forded a creek, and
then on and on we went, till at length we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
allowed to halt and fall out on either side of
the road into a last year's cornfield, to "make
fires and cook coffee."</p>

<p>To make a fire was a comparatively easy
matter, notwithstanding the rain; for some
one or other always had matches, and there
were plenty of rails at hand, and these were
dry enough when split open with a hatchet or
an axe. In a few moments the fence around
the cornfield was carried off rail by rail, and
everywhere was heard the sound of axes and
hatchets, the premonitory symptoms of roaring
camp-fires, which were soon everywhere
blazing along the road.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Lieutenant Dougal, "I
haven't any tin cup, and when you get your
coffee cooked, I believe I'll share it with you;
may I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, lieutenant. But where shall I
get water to make the coffee with? It's so
dark, that nobody can see how the land lies
so as to find a spring."</p>

<p>Without telling the lieutenant what I did,
I scooped up a tin cup full of water (whether
clear or muddy I could not tell; it was too
dark to see) out of a corn-furrow. I had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
less hesitation in doing so, because I found
all the rest were doing the same, and I argued
that if they could stand it, why I could too&mdash;and
so could the lieutenant. Tired and wet
and sleepy as I was, I could not help but be
sensible of the strange, weird appearance the
troops presented, as, coming out of the surrounding
darkness, I faced the brilliant fires
with groups of busy men about them. There
they sat, squatting about the fires, each man
with his quart tin cup suspended on one end of
his iron ramrod or on some convenient stick,
and each eager and impatient to be the first to
bring his cup to the boiling-point. Thrusting
my cup in amongst the dozen others already
smoking amid the crackling flames, I soon had
the pleasure of seeing the foam rise to the
surface,&mdash;a sure indication that my coffee
was nearly done. When the lieutenant and I
had finished drinking it, I called his attention
to the half inch of mud in the bottom of
the cup, and asked him how he liked coffee
made out of water taken from a last year's
corn-furrow? "First rate," he replied, as he
took out his tobacco pouch and pipe for a
smoke, "first rate; gives it the real old 'Virginny'
flavor, you see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
We were not permitted, however, to enjoy
the broad glare of our fires very long after
our coffee was disposed of, for we soon heard
the command to "fall in" coming down the
line. It was now half-past eleven o'clock,
and away we went again slap-dash in the
thick darkness and bottomless mud. At
three o'clock in the morning, during a brief
halt, I fell asleep while sitting on my drum,
and tumbled over into the road from sheer
exhaustion. Partly aroused by my fall, I
spread out my shelter on the road where the
mud seemed the shallowest, and lay down to
sleep, chilled to the bone and shivering like
an aspen.</p>

<p>At six o'clock we were roused up, and a
pretty appearance we presented too, for every
man was covered with mud from neck to
heel. However, daylight having now come
to our assistance, we marched on in merrier
mood in the direction of Port Royal, a place
or village on the Rappahannock some thirty
miles below Fredericksburg, and reached our
destination about ten o'clock that forenoon.</p>

<p>As we emerged from the woods and came
out into the open fields, with the river in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
view about a fourth of a mile in front, we
fully believed that now, at last, we were to
go at once into battle. And so, indeed, it
seemed, as the long column halted in a cornfield
a short distance from the river, and the
pontoon trains came up, and the pioneers
were sent forward to help lay the bridge, and
signal-flags began flying, and officers and orderlies
began to gallop gayly over the field&mdash;of
course we were now about to go into
our first battle.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to cross the river,
Harry," said Andy, as we stood together
beside a corn shock and watched the men
putting down the pontoons, "and then we'll
have to go in on 'em and gobble 'em up."</p>

<p>"Yes; gobbling up is all right. But suppose
that over in the woods yonder, on the
other side the river, there might happen to be
a lot of Johnnies watching us, and all ready
to sweep down on us and gobble <em>us</em> up,
while we are crossing the river&mdash;eh? That
wouldn't be nearly so nice, would it?"</p>

<p>"Hah!" exclaimed Andy, "I'd just like
to see 'em do it once! Look there! There
come the boys that'll take the Johnnies
through the brush!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Looking in the direction in which Andy
was pointing, that is, away to the skirt of the
woods in our rear, I beheld a battery of artillery
coming up at full gallop towards us
and making straight for the river.</p>

<p>"Just you wait, now," said Andy, with a
triumphant snap of his fingers, "till you hear
those old bull-dogs begin to bark, and you'll
see the Johnnies get up and dust!"</p>

<p>As the battery came near the spot where
we were standing, and could be plainly seen,
I exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Andy, I don't believe those dogs
can bark at all! Don't you see? They are
wooden logs covered over with black gum-blankets
and mounted on the front-wheels of
wagons, and&mdash;as sure as you're alive&mdash;it's
our quartermaster on his gray horse in command
of the battery!"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" said Andy, with a look
of mingled surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>There was no disputing the fact. Dummies
they were, those cannon which Andy
had so exultingly declared were to take the
Johnnies through the brush; and we began
at once to suspect that this whole mud-march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
was only a miserable ruse, or feint of war,
got up expressly for the purpose of deceiving
the enemy and making him believe that the
whole Union army was there in full force,
when such was by no means the case. So
there was not going to be any battle after all,
then? Such indeed, as we learned a little
later in the day, was the true state of things.
Nevertheless the pioneers went on with their
work of putting down the pontoon-boats for
a bridge, and our gallant quartermaster, on
his bobtail gray, with drawn sword, and shouting
out his commands like a veritable major-general,
swept by us with his battery of
wooden guns, and then away out into the
field like a whirlwind, apparently bent on the
most bloody work imaginable. Now the battery
would dash up and unlimber and get
into position here; then away on a gallop
across the field and go into position there;
while the quartermaster would meanwhile
swing his sword and shout himself hoarse, as
if in the very crisis of a battle.</p>

<p>It was, then, all, alas! a ruse, and there
wouldn't be any battle after all! I think the
general feeling among the men was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
disappointment, when about nine o'clock that
night we were all withdrawn from the riverside
under cover of darkness, and bivouacked
in the woods to our rear, where we were
ordered to make as many and as large fires
as we could, so as to attract the enemy's
attention, and make him believe that the
whole Army of the Potomac was concentrating
at that point; whereas the truth was
that, instead of making any movement thirty
miles <em>below</em> Fredericksburg, the Union army,
ten days later, crossed the river thirty miles
<em>above</em> Fredericksburg, and met the enemy at
Chancellorsville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Quartermaster's Triumph.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>But I have never forgotten our gallant
quartermaster, and what a fine appearance he
made as the commanding officer of a battery
of artillery. It was an amusing sight; for
the reader must remember that a quartermaster,
having to do only with army supplies,
was a non-combatant, that is to say, he did
no fighting, and in most cases "stayed by the
stuff" among his army wagons, which were
usually far enough to the rear in time of
battle. Thinking of this little episode on our
first mud-march, there comes to my mind a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
conversation I recently had with a gentleman,
my neighbor, who was also a quartermaster
in the Union army.</p>

<p>"I was down in Virginia on business last
spring," said the ex-quartermaster, "in the
neighborhood of Warrenton. (You remember
Warrenton? Fine country down there.)
And I found the people very kind and friendly,
and inclined to forget the late unpleasantness.
Well, one man came up to me, and
says he:</p>

<p>"'Major, you were in the war, weren't
you?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said I, 'I was; but (I might as
well admit it) I was on the other side of
the fence. I was in the Union army.'</p>

<p>"'You were? Well, Major, did you ever
kill anybody?'</p>

<p>"'Oh yes,' said I; 'lots of 'em,&mdash;lots of
'em, sir.'</p>

<p>"'You don't tell me!' said the Virginian.
'And if I might be so bold as to ask&mdash;how
did you generally kill them?'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said I, 'I never like to tell, because
bragging is not in my line; but I'll
tell you. You see, I never liked this thing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
shooting people. It seemed to me a barbarous
business, and besides, I was a kind of
Quaker, and had conscientious scruples about
bearing arms. And so, when the war broke
out and I found I'd have to enter the army,
maybe, whether I wanted to or not, I enlisted
and got in as a quartermaster, thinking that
in that position I wouldn't have to kill anybody
with a gun, anyhow. But war is a
dreadful thing, a dreadful thing, sir. And I
found that even a quartermaster had to take
a hand at killing people; and the way I took
for it was this: I always managed to have a
good swift horse, and as soon as things would
begin to look a little like fighting, and the
big guns would begin to boom, why I'd clap
spurs to my horse and make for the rear as
fast as ever I could. And then when your
people would come after me, they never <em>could</em>
catch me; they'd always get out of breath
trying to come up to me. And in that way
I've killed dozens of your people, sir, dozens
of them, and all without powder or ball. They
couldn't catch me, and always died for want
of breath trying to get hold of me!'"</p>

<p>We slept in the woods that night under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the dark pines and beside our great camp-fires;
and early the next morning took up
the line of march for home. We marched
all day over the hills, and as the sun was
setting, came at last to a certain hilltop
whence we could look down upon the odd-looking
group of cabins and wigwams which
we recognized as our camp, and which we
hailed with cheers as our home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="medium">HOW WE GOT A SHELLING.</span></h2>

<p>"Pack up!" "Fall in!" All is stir
and excitement in the camp. The bugles are
blowing "boots and saddles" for the cavalry
camped above us on the hill; we drummer-boys
are beating the "long roll" and "assembly"
for the regiment; mounted orderlies are
galloping along the hillside with great yellow
envelopes stuck in their belts; and the men
fall out of their miserable winter-quarters,
with shouts and cheers that make the hills
about Falmouth ring again. For the winter
is past; the sweet breath of spring comes
balmily up from the south, and the whole
army is on the move,&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>"Say, Captain, tell us where are we going?"
But the captain doesn't know, nor even the
colonel,&mdash;nobody knows. We are raw troops
yet, and have not learned that soldiers never
ask questions about orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
So, fall in there, all together, and forward!
And we ten little drummer-boys beat gayly
enough "The Girl I left behind me," as the
line sweeps over the hills, through the woods,
and on down to the river's edge.</p>

<p>And soon here we are, on the Rappahannock,
three miles below Fredericksburg. We
can see, as we emerge from the woods, away
over the river, the long line of earthworks
thrown up by the enemy, and small dark
specks moving about along the field, in the
far, dim distance, which we know to be officers,
or perhaps cavalry pickets. We can
see, too, our own first division laying down
the pontoon-bridge, on which, according to a
rumor that is spreading among us, we are to
cross the river and charge the enemy's works.</p>

<p>Here is an old army letter lying before me,
written on my drum-head in lead pencil, in
that stretch of meadow by the river, where I
heard my first shell scream and shriek:&mdash;</p>

<p class="i6 small">"<span class="smcap">Near Rappahannock River</span>, Apr. 28th.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>,&mdash;We have moved to the
river, and are just going into battle. I am
well, and so are the boys.&mdash;Your affect. son,<br />
<span class="ralign smcap">"Harry."</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
But we do not go into battle this day, nor
next day, nor at all at this point; for we
are making only a "feint," though we do not
know it now, to attract the attention of the
enemy from the main movement of the army
at Chancellorsville, some twenty-five or thirty
miles farther up the river. The men are in
good spirits and all ready for the fray; but
as the day wears on without further developments,
arms are stacked, and we begin to
roam about the hills. Some are writing letters
home, some sleeping, some even fishing
in a little rivulet that runs by us, when,
toward three o'clock in the afternoon, and
all of a sudden, the enemy opens fire on us
with a salute of three shells fired in rapid
succession, not quite into our ranks, but a
little to the left of us. And see! over there
where the 'Forty-third lies, to our left, come
three <em>stretchers</em>, and you can see deep crimson
stains on the canvas as they go by us on a
lively trot to the rear; for "the ball is opening,
boys," and we are under fire for the first
time.</p>

<p>I wish I could convey to my readers some
faint idea of the noise made by a shell as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
flies shrieking and screaming through the air,
and of that peculiar <em>whirring</em> sound made by
the pieces after the shell has burst overhead
or by your side. So loud, high-pitched, shrill,
and terrible is the sound, that one unaccustomed
to it would think at first that the very
heavens were being torn down about his
ears!</p>

<p>How often I have laughed and laughed at
myself when thinking of that first shelling we
got there by the river! For up to that time I
had had a very poor, old-fashioned idea of what
a shell was like, having derived it probably
from accounts of sieges in the Mexican war.</p>

<p>I had thought a shell was a hollow ball of
iron, filled with powder and furnished with a
fuse, and that they threw it over into your
ranks, and there it lay, hissing and spitting,
till the fire reached the powder, and the shell
burst and killed a dozen men or so; that is,
if some venturesome fellow didn't run up and
stamp the fire off the fuse before the miserable
thing went off! Of a <em>conical</em> shell, shaped
like a minie-ball, with ridges on the outside
to fit the grooves of a rifled cannon, and exploding
by a percussion-cap at the pointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
end, I had no idea in the world. But that
was the sort of thing they were firing at us
now,&mdash;Hur-r-r&mdash;bang! Hur-r-r&mdash;bang!</p>

<p>Throwing myself flat on my face while that
terrible shriek is in the air, I cling closer to
the ground while I hear that low, whirring
sound near by, which I foolishly imagine to
be the sound of a burning fuse, but which, on
raising my head and looking up and around,
I find is the sound of pieces of exploded shells
flying through the air about our heads! The
enemy has excellent range of us, and gives it
to us hot and fast, and we fall in line and
take it as best we may, and without the
pleasure of replying, for the enemy's batteries
are a full mile and a half away, and no Enfield
rifle can reach half so far.</p>

<p>"Colonel, move your regiment a little to
the right, so as to get under cover of yonder
bank." It is soon done; and there, seated on
a bank about twenty feet high, with our backs
to the enemy, we let them blaze away, for it
is not likely they can tumble a shell down at
an angle of forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>And now, see! Just to the rear of us, and
therefore in full view as we are sitting, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
battery of our own coming up into position at
full gallop,&mdash;a grand sight indeed! The officers
with swords flashing in the evening sunlight,
the bugles clanging out the orders, the
carriages unlimbered, and the guns run up
into position; and now, that ever beautiful
drill of the artillery in action, steady and regular
as the stroke of machinery! How swiftly
the man that handles the swab has prepared
his piece, while the runners have meanwhile
brought up the little red bag of powder and
the long conical shell from the caisson in the
rear! How swiftly they are rammed home!
The lieutenant sights his piece, the man with
the lanyard with a sudden jerk fires the cap,
the gun leaps five feet to the rear with the
recoil, and out of the cannon's throat, in a
cloud of smoke, rushes the shell, shrieking
out its message of death into the lines a mile
and a half away, while our boys rend the air
with wild hurrahs, for the enemy's fire is
answered!</p>

<p>Now ensues an artillery duel that keeps the
air all quivering and quaking about our ears
for an hour and a half, and it is all the more
exciting that we can see the beautiful drill of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the batteries beside us, with that steady swabbing
and ramming, running and sighting, and
bang! bang! bang! The mystery is how in
the world they can load and fire so fast.</p>

<p>"Boys, what are you trying to do?"</p>

<div><a name="general_doubleday_dismounts_and_sights_the_gun" id="general_doubleday_dismounts_and_sights_the_gun"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i112.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">General Doubleday dismounts and sights the Gun.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>It is Major-General Abner Doubleday, our
division-commander, who reins in his horse
and asks the question. He is a fine-looking
officer, and is greatly beloved by the boys.
He rides his horse beautifully, and is said to
be one of the finest artillerists in the service,
as he may well be, for it was his hand that
fired the first gun on the Union side from the
walls of Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>"Why, General, we are trying to put a shell
through that stone barn over there; it's full
of sharpshooters."</p>

<p>"Hold a moment!" and the general dismounts
and sights the gun. "Try that elevation
once, sergeant," he says; and the shell
goes crashing through the barn a mile and a
half away, and the sharpshooters come pouring
out of it like bees out of a hive. "Let
them have it so, boys." And the general has
mounted, and rides, laughing, away along the
line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Meanwhile, something is transpiring immediately
before our eyes that amuses us
greatly. Not more than twenty yards away
from us is another high bank, corresponding
exactly with the one we are occupying, and
running parallel with it, the two hills inclosing
a little ravine some twenty or thirty yards
in width.</p>

<p>This second high bank, the nearer one, you
must remember, faces the enemy's fire. The
water has worn out of the soft sand-rock a
sort of cave, in which Darkie Bill, our company
cook, took refuge at the crack of the
first shell. And there, crouching in the narrow
recess of the rock, we can see him shivering
with affright. Every now and then, when
there is a lull in the firing, he comes to the
wide-open door of his house, intent upon flight,
and, rolling up the great whites of his eyes, is
about to step out and run, when Hur-r-r&mdash;bang&mdash;crack!
goes the shell, and poor scared
Darkie Bill dives into his cave again head-first,
like a frog into a pond.</p>

<p>After repeated attempts to run and repeated
frog-leaps backward, the poor fellow
takes heart and cuts for the woods, pursued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
by the laughter and shouts of the regiment,
for which he cares far less, however, than for
that terrible shriek in the air, which, he afterward
told us, "was a-sayin' all de time,
'Where's dat nigger! Where's dat nigger!
Where's dat nigger!'"</p>

<p>As nightfall comes on, the firing ceases.
Word is passed around that under cover of
night we are to cross the pontoons and charge
the enemy's works; but we sleep soundly all
night on our arms, and are awaked only by
the first streaks of light in the morning
sky.</p>

<p>We have orders to move. A staff-officer is
delivering orders to our colonel, who is surrounded
by his staff. They press in toward
the messenger, standing immediately below
me as I sit on the bank, when the enemy gives
us a morning salute, and the shell comes
ricochetting over the hill and tumbles into a
mud-puddle about which the group is gathered;
the mounted officers crouch in their
saddles and spur hastily away, the foot officers
throw themselves flat on their faces into the
mud; the drummer-boy is bespattered with
mud and dirt; but fortunately the shell does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
not explode, or my readers would never have
heard how we got our first shelling.</p>

<p>And now, "Fall in, men!" and we are off
on a double-quick in a cloud of dust, amid the
rattle of canteens and tin cups, and the regular
<em>flop, flop</em> of cartridge-boxes and bayonet-scabbards,
pursued for two miles by the hot
fire of the enemy's batteries, for a long, hot,
weary day's march to the extreme right of the
army at Chancellorsville.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="medium">IN THE WOODS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE.</span></h2>

<p>It is no easy matter to describe a long day's
march to one who knows nothing of the hardships
of a soldier's life. That a body of troops
marched some twenty-five or thirty miles on
a certain day from daylight to midnight, from
one point to another, seems, to one who has
not tried it, no great undertaking. Thirty
miles! It is but an hour's ride in the cars.
Nor can the single pedestrian, who easily
covers greater distances in less time, have
a full idea of the fatigue of a soldier as he
throws himself down by the roadside, utterly
exhausted, when the day's march is done.</p>

<p>Unnumbered circumstances combine to test
the soldier's powers of endurance to the very
utmost. He has, in the first place, a heavy
load to carry. His knapsack, haversack, canteen,
ammunition, musket, and accoutrements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
are by no means a light matter at the outset,
and they grow heavier with every additional
mile of the road. So true is this, that, in deciding
what of our clothing to take along on
a march and what to throw away, we soon
learned to be guided by the soldiers' proverb
that "what weighs an ounce in the morning
weighs a pound at night." Then, too, the
soldier is not master of his own movements,
as is the solitary pedestrian; for he cannot
pick his way, nor husband his strength by
resting when and where he may choose. He
marches generally "four abreast," sometimes
at double-quick, when the rear is closing up,
and again at a most provokingly slow pace
when there is some impediment on the road
ahead. Often his canteen is empty, no water
is to be had, and he marches on in a cloud of
dust, with parched throat and lips and trembling
limbs,&mdash;on and on, and still on, until
about the midnight hour, at the final "Halt!"
he drops to the ground like a shot, feverish,
irritable, exhausted in body and soul.</p>

<p>It would seem a shame and a folly to take
troops thus utterly worn out, and hurl them
at midnight into a battle the issue of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
hangs trembling in the balance. Yet this was
what they came pretty near doing with us,
after our long march from four miles below
Fredericksburg to the extreme right of the
army at Chancellorsville.</p>

<div><a name="a_surgeon_writing_upon_the_pommel_of_his_saddle_an_order_for_an_ambulance" id="a_surgeon_writing_upon_the_pommel_of_his_saddle_an_order_for_an_ambulance"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">A Surgeon writing upon the Pommel of his Saddle an Order
for an Ambulance.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>I have a very indistinct and cloudy recollection
of that march. I can quite well remember
the beginning of it, when at the early
dawn the enemy's batteries drove us, under a
sharp shell-fire, at a lively double-quick for
the first four miles. And I can well recall
how, at midnight, we threw ourselves under
the great oak-trees near Chancellorsville, and
were in a moment sound asleep amid the
heaven-rending thunder of the guns, the unbroken
roll of the musketry, and the shouts
and yells of the lines charging each other a
quarter of a mile to our front. But when I
attempt to call up the incidents that happened
by the way, I am utterly at a loss. My memory
has retained nothing but a confused mass
of images: here a farmhouse, there a mill;
a company of stragglers driven on by the
guard; a surgeon writing upon the pommel
of his saddle an order for an ambulance to
carry a poor exhausted and but half-conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
fellow; an officer's staff or an orderly dashing
by at a lively trot; a halt for coffee in the
edge of a wood; filling a canteen (oh, blessed
memory!) at some meadow stream or roadside
spring; and on, and on, and on, amid
the rattle of bayonet-scabbards and tin cups,
mopping our faces and crunching our hard-tack
as we went,&mdash;this, and such as this, is
all that will now come to mind.</p>

<p>But of events toward nightfall the images
are clearer and more sharply defined. The
sun is setting, large, red, and fiery-looking,
in a dull haze that hangs over the thickly-wooded
horizon. We are nearing the ford
where we are to cross the Rappahannock.
We come to some hilltop, and&mdash;hark! A
deep, ominous growl comes, from how many
miles away we know not; now another; then
another!</p>

<p>On, boys, on! There is work doing ahead,
and terrible work it is, for two great armies
are at each other's throat, and the battle is
raging fierce and high, although we know
nothing as yet of how it may be going.</p>

<p>On,&mdash;on,&mdash;on!</p>

<p>Turning sharp to the left, we enter the approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to the ford, the road leading, in places,
through a deep cut,&mdash;great high pine-trees on
either side of the road shutting out the little
remaining light of day. Here we find the
first actual evidences of the great battle that
is raging ahead: long lines of ambulances
filled with wounded; yonder a poor fellow with
a bandaged head sitting by a spring; and a
few steps away another, his agonies now over;
here, two men, one with his arm in a sling
supporting the other, who has turned his musket
into a crutch; then more ambulances, and
more wounded in increasing numbers; orderlies
dashing by at full gallop, while the thunder
of the guns grows louder and closer as we
step on the pontoons and so cross the gleaming
river.</p>

<p>"Colonel, your men have had a hard day's
march; you will now let them rest for the
night."</p>

<p>It is a staff-officer whom I hear delivering
this order to our colonel, and a sweeter message
I think I never heard. We cast wistful
eyes at the half-extinguished camp-fires of
some regiment that has been making coffee by
the roadside, and has just moved off, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
think them a godsend, as the order is given to
"Stack arms!" But before we have time even
to unsling knapsacks, the order comes, "Fall
in!" and away we go again, steadily plodding
on through that seemingly endless forest of
scrub-pine and oak, straight in the direction of
the booming guns ahead.</p>

<p>Why whippoorwills were made I do not
know; doubtless for some wise purpose; but
never before that night did I know they had
been made in such countless numbers. Every
tree and bush was full of them, it seemed.
There were thousands of them, there were tens
of thousands of them, there were millions of
them! And every one whistling, as fast as it
could, "Who-hoo-hoo! Who-hoo-hoo! Who-hoo-hoo!"
Had they been vultures or turkey-buzzards,&mdash;vast
flocks of which followed the
army wherever we went, almost darkening the
sky at times, and always suggesting unpleasant
reflections,&mdash;they could not have appeared
more execrable to me. Many were the imprecations
hurled at them as we plodded on under
the light of the great red moon, now above the
tree-tops, while still from every bush came that
monotonous half-screech, half-groan, "Who-hoo-hoo!
Who-hoo-hoo!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
But, O miserable birds of ill-omen, there is
something more ominous in the air than your
lugubrious night-song! There is borne to our
ears at every additional step the deepening
growl of the cannon ahead. As the moon
mounts higher, and we advance farther along
the level forest-land, we hear still more distinctly
another sound&mdash;the long, unbroken
roll of musketry.</p>

<p>Forward now, at double-quick, until we are
on the outskirts of the battle-field.</p>

<p>Shells are crashing through the tall tree-tops
overhead.</p>

<p>"Halt! Load at will! Load!"</p>

<p>In the moonlight that falls shimmering
across the road, as I look back over the column,
I see the bright steel flashing, while the
jingle of the ramrods makes music that stirs
the blood to a quicker pulse. A well-known
voice calls me down the line, and Andy whispers
a few hurried words into my ear, while
he grasps my hand hard. But we are off at
a quick step. A sharp turn to the left, and&mdash;hark!
The firing has ceased, and they are
"charging" down there! That peculiar, and
afterward well-known, "Yi! Yi! Yi!" indicates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a struggle for which we are making
straight and fast.</p>

<p>At this moment comes the order: "Colonel,
you will countermarch your men, and take
position down this road on the right. Follow
me!" The staff-officer leads us half a mile
to the right, where, sinking down utterly exhausted,
we are soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>Of the next day or two I have but an indistinct
recollection. What with the fatigue and
excitement, the hunger and thirst, of the last
few days, a high fever set in for me. I
became half-delirious, and lay under a great
oak-tree, too weak to walk, my head nearly
splitting with the noise of a battery of steel
cannon in position fifty yards to the left of me.
That battery's beautiful but terrible drill I
could plainly see. My own corps was put on
reserve: the men built strong breastworks,
but took no part in the battle, excepting some
little skirmishing. Our day was yet to come.</p>

<p>One evening,&mdash;it was the last evening we
spent in the woods at Chancellorsville,&mdash;a
sergeant of my company came back to where
we were, with orders for me to hunt up and
bring an ambulance for one of the lieutenants
who was sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
"You see, Harry, there are rumors that we
are going to retreat to-night, for the heavy
rains have so swollen the Rappahannock that
our pontoons are in danger of being carried
away, and it appears that, for some reason or
other, we've got to get out of this at once
under cover of night, and lieutenant can't
stand the march. So you will go for an ambulance.
You'll find the ambulance-park
about two miles from here. You'll take
through the woods in that direction,"&mdash;pointing
with his finger,&mdash;"until you come to a
path; follow the path till you come to a
road; follow the road, taking to the right
and straight ahead, till you come to the
ambulances."</p>

<p>Although it was raining hard at the time,
and had been raining for several days, and
though I myself was probably as sick as the
lieutenant, and felt positive that the troops
would have started in retreat before I could
get back, yet it was my duty to obey, and off
I went.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in finding the path; and
I reached the road all right. Fording a
stream, the corduroy bridge of which was all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
afloat, and walking rapidly for a half-hour, I
found the ambulances all drawn up ready to
retreat.</p>

<p>"We have orders to pull out from here at
once, and can send an ambulance for no man.
Your lieutenant must take his chance."</p>

<p>It was getting dark fast, as I started back
with this message. I was soaked to the skin,
and the rain was pouring down in torrents.
To make bad worse, in the darkness I turned
off from the road at the wrong point, missed
the path, and quite lost my way! What was
to be done? If I should spend much time
where I was, I was certain to be left behind,
for I felt sure that the troops were moving
off; and yet I feared to make for any of the
fires I saw through the woods, for I knew the
lines of the two armies were near each other,
and I might, as like as not, walk over into the
lines of the enemy.</p>

<p>Collecting my poor fevered faculties, I determined
to follow the course of a little stream I
heard plashing down among the bushes to the
left. By and by I fixed my eye on a certain
bright camp-fire, and determined to make for
it at all hazards, be it of friend or of foe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Judge of my joyful surprise when I found it
was burning in front of my own tent!</p>

<p>Standing about our fire trying to get warm
and dry, our fellows were discussing the question
of the retreat about to be made. But I
was tired and sick, and wet and sleepy, and
did not at all relish the prospect of a night-march
through the woods in a drenching rain.
So, putting on the only remaining dry shirt I
had left (I had <em>two</em> on already, and they were
soaked through), I lay down under my shelter,
shivering and with chattering teeth, but soon
fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>In the gray light of the morning we were
suddenly awakened by a loud "Halloo there,
you chaps! Better be digging out of this!
We're the last line of cavalry pickets, and the
Johnnies are on our heels!"</p>

<p>It was an easy matter for us to sling on our
knapsacks and rush after the cavalry-man,
until a double-quick of two miles brought us
within the rear line of defences thrown up to
cover the retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="medium">THE FIRST DAY AT GETTYSBURG.</span></h2>

<p>"Harry, I'm getting tired of this thing.
It's becoming monotonous, this thing of being
roused every morning at four, with orders to
pack up and be ready to march at a moment's
notice, and then lying around here all day in
the sun. I don't believe we are going anywhere,
anyhow."</p>

<p>We had been encamped for six weeks, of
which I need give no special account, only
saying that in those "summer quarters," as
they might be called, we went on with our
endless drilling, and were baked and browned,
and thoroughly hardened to the life of a soldier
in the field.</p>

<p>The monotony of which Andy complained
did not end that day, nor the next. For six
successive days we were regularly roused at
four o'clock in the morning, with orders to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
"pack up and be ready to move immediately!"
only to unpack as regularly about
the middle of the afternoon. We could hear
our batteries pounding away in the direction
of Fredericksburg, but we did not then know
that we were being held well in hand till the
enemy's plan had developed itself into the
great march into Pennsylvania, and we were
let off in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>So, at last, on the 12th of June, 1863, we
started, at five o'clock in the morning, in a
north-westerly direction. My journal says:
"Very warm, dust plenty, water scarce,
marching very hard. Halted at dusk at an
excellent spring, and lay down for the night
with aching limbs and blistered feet."</p>

<p>I pass over the six days' continuous marching
that followed, steadily on toward the
north, pausing only to relate several incidents
that happened by the way.</p>

<p>On the 14th we were racing with the enemy&mdash;we
being pushed on to the utmost of human
endurance&mdash;for the possession of the defences
of Washington. From five o'clock of that
morning till three the following morning,&mdash;that
is to say, from daylight to daylight,&mdash;we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
were hurried along under a burning June sun,
with no halt longer than sufficient to recruit
our strength with a hasty cup of coffee at
noon and nightfall. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve
o'clock at night, and still on! It was almost
more than flesh could endure. Men fell out
of line in the darkness by the score, and
tumbled over by the roadside, asleep almost
before they touched the ground.</p>

<p>I remember how a great tall fellow in our
company made us laugh along somewhere
about one o'clock that morning,&mdash;"Pointer,"
we called him,&mdash;an excellent soldier, who
afterward fell at his post at Spottsylvania.
He had been trudging on in sullen silence
for hours, when all of a sudden, coming to
a halt, he brought his piece to "order arms"
on the hard road with a ring, took off his
cap, and, in language far more forcible than
elegant, began forthwith to denounce both
parties to the war, "from A to Izzard," in
all branches of the service, civil and military,
army and navy, artillery, infantry, and cavalry,
and demanded that the enemy should
come on in full force here and now, "and
I'll fight them all, single-handed and alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the whole pack of 'em! I'm tired of this
everlasting marching, and I want to fight!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Pointer!" cried some
one, and we laughed heartily as we toiled
doggedly on to Manassas, which we reached
at three o'clock <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, June 15th. I can assure
you we lost no time in stretching ourselves at
full length in the tall summer grass.</p>

<p>"James McFadden, report to the adjutant
for camp guard! James McFadden! Anybody
know where Jim McFadden is?"</p>

<p>Now that was rather hard, wasn't it? To
march from daylight to daylight, and lie down
for a rest of probably two hours before starting
again, and then to be called up to stand
throughout those precious two hours on guard
duty!</p>

<p>I knew very well where McFadden was, for
wasn't he lying right beside me in the grass?
But just then I was in no humor to tell. The
camp might well go without a guard that
night, or the orderly might find McFadden
in the dark if he could.</p>

<p>But the rules were strict, and the punishment
was severe, and poor McFadden, bursting
into tears of vexation, answered like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
man: "Here I am, Orderly; I'll go." It was
hard.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, both McFadden and the
orderly went where there is neither marching
nor standing guard any more.</p>

<p>Now comes a long rest of a week in the
woods near the Potomac; for we have been
marching parallel with the enemy, and dare
not go too fast, lest by some sudden and dexterous
move in the game he should sweep
past our rear in upon the defences of Washington.
And after this sweet refreshment, we
cross the Potomac on pontoons, and march,
perhaps with a lighter step, since we are
nearing home, through the smiling fields
and pleasant villages of "Maryland, my
Maryland." At Poolesville, a little town on
the north bank of the Potomac, we smile as
we see a lot of children come trooping out of
the village school,&mdash;a merry sight to men
who have seen neither woman nor child these
six months and more, and a touching sight to
many a man in the ranks as he thinks of
his little flaxen-heads in the far-away home.
Ay, think of them now, and think of them
full tenderly too, for many a man of you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
shall never have child climb on his knee
any more!</p>

<p>As we enter one of these pleasant little
Maryland villages,&mdash;Jefferson by name,&mdash;we
find on the outskirts of the place two
young ladies and two young gentlemen waving
the good old flag as we pass, and singing
"Rally round the Flag, Boys!" The excitement
along the line is intense. Cheer on
cheer is given by regiment after regiment as
we pass along, we drummer-boys beating, at
the colonel's express orders, the old tune,
"The Girl I left behind me," as a sort of
response. Soon we are in among the hills
again, and still the cheering goes on in the
far distance to the rear.</p>

<p>Only ten days later we passed through the
same village again, and were met by the same
young ladies and gentlemen, waving the same
flag and singing the same song. But though
we tried twice, and tried hard, we could not
cheer at all; for there's a difference between
five hundred men and one hundred,&mdash;is there
not? So, that second time, we drooped our
tattered flags, and raised our caps in silent
and sorrowful salute. Through Middletown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
next, where a rumor reaches us that the enemy's
forces have occupied Harrisburg, and
where certain ladies, standing on a balcony
and waving their handkerchiefs as we pass
by, in reply to our colonel's greeting, that
"we are glad to see so many Union people
here," answer, "Yes; and we are glad to see
the Yankee soldiers too."</p>

<p>From Middletown, at six o'clock in the
evening, across the mountain to Frederick,
on the outskirts of which city we camp for
the night. At half-past five next morning
(June 29th) we are up and away, in a drizzling
rain, through Lewistown and Mechanicstown,
near which latter place we pass a company
of Confederate prisoners, twenty-four in
number, dressed in well-worn gray and butternut,
which makes us think that the enemy
cannot be far ahead. After a hard march of
twenty-five miles, the greater part of the way
over a turnpike, we reach Emmittsburg at
nightfall, some of us quite barefoot, and all
of us footsore and weary. Next morning
(June 30th) at nine o'clock we are up and
away again, "on the road leading towards
Gettysburg," they say. After crossing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
line between Maryland and Pennsylvania,
where the colonel halts the column for a
moment, in order that we may give three
rousing cheers for the Old Keystone State,
we march perceptibly slower, as if there were
some impediment in the way. There is a
feeling among the men that the enemy is
somewhere near. Towards noon we leave the
public road, and taking across the fields, form
in line of battle along the rear of a wood, and
pickets are thrown out. There is an air of
uncertainty and suspicion in the ranks as we
look to the woods, and consider what our
pickets may possibly unmask there. But no
developments have yet been made when darkness
comes, and we bivouac for the night
behind a strong stone wall.</p>

<p>Passing down along the line of glowing
fires in the gathering gloom, I come on one
of my company messes squatting about a fire,
cooking supper. Joe Gutelius, corporal and
color-guard from our company, is superintending
the boiling of a piece of meat in a
tin can, while Sam Ruhl and his brother Joe
are smoking their pipes near by.</p>

<p>"Boys, it begins to look a little dubious,
don't it? Where is Jimmy Lucas?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
"He's out on picket in the woods yonder.
Yes, Harry, it begins to look a little as if we
were about to stir the Johnnies out of the
brush," says Joe Gutelius, throwing another
rail on the fire.</p>

<p>"If we do," says Joe Ruhl, "remember
that you have the post of honor, Joe, and
'if any man pulls down that flag, shoot him
on the spot!'"</p>

<p>"Never you fear for that," answers Joe
Gutelius. "We of the color-guard will look
out for the flag. For my part, I'll stay a
dead man on the field before the colors of
the 150th are disgraced."</p>

<p>"You'll have some tough tussling for your
colors, then," says Sam. "If the Louisiana
Tigers get after you once, look out!"</p>

<p>"Who's afraid of the Louisiana Tigers?
I'll back the Buck-tails against the Tigers any
day. Stay and take supper with us, Harry!
We are going to have a feast to-night. I
have the heart of a beef boiling in the can
yonder; and it is done now. Sit up, boys,
get out your knives and fall to."</p>

<p>"We were going to have boiled lion heart
for supper, Harry," says Joe Ruhl with mock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
apology for the fare, "but we couldn't catch
any lions. They seem to be scarce in these
parts. Maybe we can catch a tiger to-morrow,
though."</p>

<p>Little do we think, as we sit thus cheerily
talking about the blazing fire behind the
stone-wall, that it is our last supper together,
and that ere another nightfall two of us will
be sleeping in the silent bivouac of the dead.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>"Colonel, close up your men, and move on
as rapidly as possible."</p>

<p>It is the morning of July 1st, and we are
crossing a bridge over a stream, as the staff-officer,
having delivered this order for us,
dashes down the line to hurry up the regiments
in the rear. We get up on a high
range of hills, from which we have a magnificent
view. The day is bright, the air is
fresh and sweet with the scent of the new-mown
hay, and the sun shines out of an
almost cloudless sky, and as we gaze away off
yonder down the valley to the left&mdash;look!
Do you see that? A puff of smoke in mid-air!
Very small, and miles away, as the faint
and long-coming "boom" of the exploding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
shell indicates; but it means that something
is going on yonder, away down in the valley,
in which, perhaps, we may have a hand before
the day is done. See! another&mdash;and another!
Faint and far away comes the
long-delayed "boom!" "boom!" echoing
over the hills, as the staff-officer dashes along
the lines with orders to "double-quick!
double-quick!"</p>

<p>Four miles of almost constant double-quicking
is no light work at any time, least of
all on such a day as this memorable first day
of July, for it is hot and dusty. But we are
in our own State now, boys, and the battle is
opening ahead, and it is no time to save
breath. On we go, now up a hill, now over a
stream, now checking our headlong rush for a
moment, for we <em>must</em> breathe a little. But
the word comes along the line again, "double-quick,"
and we settle down to it with right
good-will, while the cannon ahead seem to be
getting nearer and louder. There's little said
in the ranks, for there is little breath for
talking, though every man is busy enough
thinking. We all feel, somehow, that our
day has come at last&mdash;as indeed it has!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
We get in through the outskirts of Gettysburg,
tearing down the fences of the town-lots
and outlying gardens as we go; we pass
a battery of brass guns drawn up beside the
Seminary, some hundred yards in front of
which building, in a strip of meadow-land, we
halt, and rapidly form the line of battle.</p>

<p>"General, shall we unsling knapsacks?"
shouts some one down the line to our
division-general, as he is dashing by.</p>

<p>"Never mind the knapsacks, boys; it's the
State now!"</p>

<p>And he plunges his spurs into the flanks
of his horse, as he takes the stake-and-rider
fence at a leap, and is away.</p>

<p>"Unfurl the flags, Color-guard!"</p>

<p>"Now, forward, double&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel, we're not loaded yet!"</p>

<p>A laugh runs along the line as, at the
command "Load at will&mdash;load!" the ramrods
make their merry music, and at once the
word is given, "Forward, double-quick!" and
the line sweeps up that rising ground with
banners gayly flying, and cheers that rend
the air,&mdash;a sight, once seen, never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
I suppose my readers wonder what a drummer-boy
does in time of battle. Perhaps they
have the same idea I used to have, namely,
that it is the duty of a drummer-boy to beat
his drum all the time the battle rages, to
encourage the men or drown the groans of
the wounded! But if they will reflect a
moment, they will see that amid the confusion
and noise of battle, there is little chance
of martial music being either heard or heeded.
Our colonel had long ago given us our
orders:</p>

<p>"You drummer-boys, in time of an engagement,
are to lay aside your drums and take
stretchers and help off the wounded. I
expect you to do this, and you are to remember
that, in doing it, you are just as much
helping the battle on as if you were fighting
with guns in your hands."</p>

<p>And so we sit down there on our drums
and watch the line going in with cheers.
Forthwith we get a smart shelling, for there
is evidently somebody else watching that
advancing line besides ourselves; but they
have elevated their guns a little too much, so
that every shell passes quite over the line and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
ploughs up the meadow-sod about <em>us</em> in all
directions.</p>

<div><a name="a_skirmish_after_a_hard_days_march" id="a_skirmish_after_a_hard_days_march"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i140.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">A Skirmish after a Hard Day's March</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Laying aside our knapsacks, we go to
the Seminary, now rapidly filling with the
wounded. This the enemy surely cannot
know, or they wouldn't shell the building so
hard! We get stretchers at the ambulances,
and start out for the line of battle. We can
just see our regimental colors waving in the
orchard, near a log-house about three hundred
yards ahead, and we start out for it&mdash;I on
the lead, and Daney behind.</p>

<p>There is one of our batteries drawn up to
our left a short distance as we run. It is
engaged in a sharp artillery duel with one of
the enemy's, which we cannot see, although
we can hear it plainly enough, and straight
between the two our road lies. So, up we go,
Daney and I, at a lively trot, dodging the
shells as best we can, till, panting for breath,
we set down our stretcher under an apple-tree
in the orchard, in which, under the brow
of the hill, we find the regiment lying, one or
two companies being out on the skirmish line
ahead.</p>

<p>I count six men of Company C lying yonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
in the grass&mdash;killed, they say, by a single
shell. Close beside them lies a tall, magnificently
built man, whom I recognize by his
uniform as belonging to the "Iron Brigade,"
and therefore probably an Iowa boy. He lies
on his back at full length, with his musket
beside him&mdash;calm-looking as if asleep, but
having a fatal blue mark on his forehead and
the ashen pallor of death on his countenance.
Andy calls me away for a moment to look
after some poor fellow whose arm is off at
the shoulder; and it was just time I got
away, too, for immediately a shell plunges into
the sod where I had been sitting, tearing my
stretcher to tatters, and ploughing up a great
furrow under one of the boys who had been
sitting immediately behind me, and who
thinks, "That was rather close shaving, wasn't
it, now?" The bullets whistling overhead
make pretty music with their ever-varying
"z-i-p! z-i-p!" and we could imagine them so
many bees, only they have such a terribly
sharp sting. They tell me, too, of a certain
cavalry-man (Dennis Buckley, Sixth Michigan
cavalry it was, as I afterwards learned&mdash;let
history preserve the brave boy's name) who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
having had his horse shot under him, and
seeing that first-named shell explode in
Company C with such disaster, exclaimed,
"That is the company for me!" He remained
with the regiment all day, doing good
service with his carbine, and he escaped
unhurt!</p>

<p>"Here they come, boys; we'll have to go
in at them on a charge, I guess!" Creeping
close around the corner of the log-house, I
can see the long lines of gray sweeping up in
fine style over the fields; but I feel the
colonel's hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Keep back, my boy; no use exposing
yourself in that way."</p>

<p>As I get back behind the house and look
around, an old man is seen approaching our
line through the orchard in the rear. He is
dressed in a long blue swallow-tailed coat
and high silk hat, and coming up to the
colonel, he asks:</p>

<p>"Would you let an old chap like me have a
chance to fight in your ranks, colonel?"</p>

<p>"Can you shoot?" inquires the colonel.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can shoot, I reckon," says he.</p>

<p>"But where are your cartridges?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
"I've got 'em here, sir," says the old man,
slapping his hand on his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>And so "old John Burns," of whom every
school-boy has heard, takes his place in the
line and loads and fires with the best of them,
and is left wounded and insensible on the field
when the day is done.</p>

<p>Reclining there under a tree while the skirmishing
is going on in front and the shells
are tearing up the sod around us, I observe
how evidently hard pressed is that battery
yonder in the edge of the wood, about fifty
yards to our right. The enemy's batteries
have excellent range on the poor fellows serving
it. And when the smoke lifts or rolls
away in great clouds for a moment, we can see
the men running, and ramming, and sighting,
and firing, and swabbing, and changing position
every few minutes to throw the enemy's
guns out of range a little. The men are
becoming terribly few, but nevertheless their
guns, with a rapidity that seems unabated,
belch forth great clouds of smoke, and send
the shells shrieking over the plain.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">At Close Quarters the First Day at Gettysburg.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, events occur which give us something
more to think of than mere skirmishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and shelling. Our beloved brigadier-general,
Roy Stone, stepping out a moment to reconnoitre
the enemy's position and movements, is
seen by some sharpshooter off in a tree, and
is carried, severely wounded, into the barn.
Our colonel, Langhorne Wister, assumes command
of the brigade. Our regiment, facing
westward, while the line on our right faces to
the north, is observed to be exposed to an
enfilading fire from the enemy's guns, as well
as from the long line of gray now appearing
in full sight on our right. So our regiment
must form in line and "change front forward,"
in order to come in line with the other regiments.
Accomplished swiftly, this new movement
brings our line at once face to face with
the enemy's, which advances to within fifty
yards, and exchanges a few volleys, but is soon
checked and staggered by our fire.</p>

<p>Yet now, see! Away to our left, and consequently
on our flank, a new line appears,
rapidly advancing out of the woods a half-mile
away, and there must be some quick and sharp
work done now, boys, or, between the old foes
in front and the new ones on our flank, we
shall be annihilated. To clear us of these old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
assailants in front before the new line can
sweep down on our flank, our brave colonel,
in a ringing command, orders a charge along
the whole line. Then, before the gleaming
and bristling bayonets of our "Buck-tail"
brigade, as it yells and cheers, sweeping
resistlessly over the field, the enemy gives
way and flies in confusion. But there is
little time to watch them fly, for that new
line on our left is approaching at a rapid pace;
and, with shells falling thick and fast into our
ranks, and men dropping everywhere, our regiment
must reverse the former movement by
"changing front to rear," and so resume its
original position facing westward, for the
enemy's new line is approaching from that
direction, and if it takes us in flank, we are
done for.</p>

<p>To "change front to rear" is a difficult
movement to execute even on drill, much more
so under severe fire; but it is executed now
steadily and without confusion, yet not a minute
too soon! For the new line of gray is
upon us in a mad tempest of lead, supported
by a cruel artillery fire, almost before our line
can steady itself to receive the shock. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
partially protected by a post-and-rail
fence, we answer fiercely, and with effect so
terrific that the enemy's line wavers, and at
length moves off by the right flank, giving us
a breathing space for a time.</p>

<p>During this struggle, there had been many
an exciting scene all along the line as it
swayed backward and forward over the field,&mdash;scenes
which we have had no time to mention
yet.</p>

<p>See yonder, where the colors of the regiment
on our right&mdash;our sister regiment, the 149th&mdash;have
been advanced a little, to draw the
enemy's fire, while our line sweeps on to the
charge. There ensues about the flags a wild
<em>mêlée</em> and close hand-to-hand encounter. Some
of the enemy have seized the colors and are
making off with them in triumph, shouting
victory. But a squad of our own regiment
dashes out swiftly, led to the rescue of the
stolen colors by Sergeant John C. Kensill, of
Company F, who falls to the ground before
reaching them, and amid yells and cheers and
smoke, you see the battle-flags rise and fall,
and sway hither and thither upon the surging
mass, as if tossed on the billows of a tempest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
until, wrenched away by strong arms, they are
borne back in triumph to the line of the 149th.</p>

<p>See yonder, again! Our colonel is clapping
his hand to his cheek, from which a red
stream is pouring; our lieutenant-colonel,
H. S. Huidekoper, is kneeling on the ground,
and is having his handkerchief tied tight
around his arm at the shoulder; Major Thomas
Chamberlain and Adjutant Richard L. Ashurst
both lie low, pierced with balls through the
chest; one lieutenant is waving his sword to
his men, although his leg is crushed at the
knee; three other officers of the line are lying
over there, motionless now forever. All over
the field are strewn men wounded or dead, and
comrades pause a moment in the mad rush to
catch the last words of the dying. Incidents
such as these the reader must imagine for
himself, to fill in these swift sketches of how
the day was won&mdash;and lost!</p>

<p>Ay, lost! For the balls which have so far
come mainly from our front, begin now to sing
in from our left and right, which means that
we are being flanked. Somehow, away off to
our right, a half-mile or so, our line has given
way, and is already on retreat through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
town, while our left is being driven in, and we
ourselves may shortly be surrounded and
crushed&mdash;and so the retreat is sounded.</p>

<p>Back now along the railroad cut we go, or
through the orchard and the narrow strip of
woods behind it, with our dead scattered
around on all sides, and the wounded crying
piteously for help.</p>

<p>"Harry! Harry!" It is a faint cry of a
dying man yonder in the grass, and I <em>must</em> see
who it is.</p>

<p>"Why, Willie! Tell me where you are
hurt," I ask, kneeling down beside him; and
I see the words come hard, for he is fast dying.</p>

<p>"Here in my side, Harry. Tell&mdash;mother&mdash;mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Poor fellow, he can say no more. His head
falls back, and Willie is at rest forever!</p>

<p>On, now, through that strip of woods, at the
other edge of which, with my back against
a stout oak, I stop and look at a beautiful
and thrilling sight. Some reserves are being
brought up; infantry in the centre, the colors
flying and officers shouting; cavalry on the
right, with sabres flashing and horses on a
trot; artillery on the left, with guns at full
gallop sweeping into position to check the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
headlong pursuit,&mdash;it is a grand sight, and
a fine rally; but a vain one, for in an hour we
are swept off the field, and are in full retreat
through the town.</p>

<p>Up through the streets hurries the remnant
of our shattered corps, while the enemy is
pouring into the town only a few squares away
from us. There is a tempest of shrieking
shells and whistling balls about our ears.
The guns of that battery by the woods we
have dragged along, all the horses being disabled.
The artillery-men load as we go,
double-charging with grape and canister.</p>

<p>"Make way there, men!" is the cry, and
the surging mass crowds close up on the
sidewalks to right and left, leaving a long
lane down the centre of the street, through
which the grape and canister go rattling into
the ranks of the enemy's advance-guard.</p>

<p>And so, amid scenes which I have neither
space nor power to describe, we gain Cemetery
Ridge towards sunset, and throw ourselves
down by the road in a tumult of excitement
and grief, having lost the day through the
overwhelming force of numbers, and yet
somehow having gained it too (although as
yet we know it not), for the sacrifice of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
corps has saved the position for the rest of
the army, which has been marching all day,
and which comes pouring in over Cemetery
Ridge all night long.</p>

<p>Ay, the position is saved; but where is
our corps? Well may our division-general,
Doubleday, who early in the day succeeded to
the command when our brave Reynolds had
fallen, shed tears of grief as he sits there on
his horse and looks over the shattered remains
of that First Army Corps, for there is but a
handful of it left. Of the five hundred and
fifty men that marched under our regimental
colors in the morning, but one hundred
remain. All our field and staff officers are
gone. Of some twenty captains and lieutenants,
but one is left without a scratch,
while of my own company only thirteen out
of fifty-four sleep that night on Cemetery
Ridge, under the open canopy of heaven.
There is no roll-call, for Sergeant Weidensaul
will call the roll no more; nor will Joe
Gutelius, nor Joe Ruhl, nor McFadden, nor
Henning, nor many others of our comrades
whom we miss, ever answer to their names
again until the world's last great reveille.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="medium">AFTER THE BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>I had frequently seen pictures of battle-fields,
and had often read about them; but
the most terrible scenes of carnage my boyish
imagination had ever figured fell far short of
the dreadful reality as I beheld it after the
great battle of the war. It was the evening
of Sunday, July 5, 1863, when, at the suggestion
of Andy, we took our way across the
breastworks, stone fences, and redoubts, to
look over the battle-field. Our shattered
brigade had been mainly on reserve during
the last three days; and as we made our way
through the troops lying in our front, and
over the defences of stone and earth and
ragged rocks, the scene among our troops was
one for the pencil of a great artist.</p>

<p>Scattered about irregularly were groups of
men discussing the battle and its results, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
relating exciting incidents and adventures of
the fray: here, one fellow pointing out bullet-holes
in his coat or cap, or a great rent in the
sleeve of his blouse made by a flying piece of
shell; there, a man laughing as he held up
his crushed canteen, or showed his tobacco-box
with a hole in the lid and a bullet among
his "fine cut"; yonder, knots of men frying
steaks and cooking coffee about the fire, or
making ready for sleep.</p>

<p>Before we pass beyond our own front line,
evidences of the terrible carnage of the battle
environ us on all sides. Fresh, hastily dug
graves are there, with rude head-boards telling
the poor fellows' names and regiments;
yonder, a tree on whose smooth bark the
names of three Confederate generals, who fell
here in the gallant charge, have been carved
by some thoughtful hand. The trees round
about are chipped by the balls and stripped
almost bare by the leaden hail, while a log-house
near by in the clearing has been so
riddled with shot and shell that scarcely a
whole shingle is left to its roof.</p>

<p>But sights still more fearful await us as we
step out beyond the front line, pick our way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
carefully among the great rocks, and walk
down the slope to the scene of the fearful
charge. The ground has been soaked with the
recent rains, and the heavy mist which hangs
like a pall over the field, together with the
growing darkness, renders objects but indistinctly
visible, and all the more ghastly. As
the eye ranges over so much of the field as
the shrouding mist allows us to see, we behold
a scene of destruction terrible indeed, if ever
there was one in all this wide world! Dismounted
gun-carriages, shattered caissons,
knapsacks, haversacks, muskets, bayonets,
accoutrements, scattered over the field in
wildest confusion,&mdash;horses (poor creatures!)
dead and dying,&mdash;and, worst and most awful
of all, dead men by the hundreds! Most of
the men in blue have been buried already, and
the pioneers yonder in the mist are busy
digging trenches for the poor fellows in gray.</p>

<p>As we pass along, we stop to observe how
thickly they lie, here and there, like grain before
the scythe in summer-time,&mdash;how firmly
some have grasped their guns, with high, defiant
looks,&mdash;and how calm are the countenances
of others in their last solemn sleep;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
while more than one has clutched in his stiffened
fingers a piece of white paper, which he
waved, poor soul, in his death-agony, as a plea
for quarter, when the great wave of battle had
receded and left him there, mortally wounded,
on the field.</p>

<p>I sicken of the dreadful scene,&mdash;can endure
it no longer,&mdash;and beg Andy to "Come away!
Come away! It's too awful to look at any
more!"</p>

<p>And so we get back to our place in the
breastworks with sad, heavy hearts, and wonder
how we ever could have imagined war so
grand and gallant a thing when, after all, it is
so horribly wicked and cruel. We lie down&mdash;the
thirteen of us that are left in the company&mdash;on
a big flat rock, sleeping without
shelter, and shielding our faces from the drizzling
rain with our caps as best we may,
thinking of the dreadful scene in front there,
and of the sad, heavy hearts there will be all
over the land for weary years, till kindly sleep
comes to us, with sweet forgetfulness of all.</p>

<p>Our clothes were damp with the heavy mists
and drizzling rain when we awoke next morning,
and hastily prepared for the march off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the field and the long pursuit of the foe
through the waving grain-fields of Maryland.
Having cooked our coffee in our blackened
tin cups, and roasted our slices of fresh beef,
stuck on the end of a ramrod and thrust into
the crackling fires, we were ready in a moment
for the march, for we had but little to
pack up.</p>

<p>Straight over the field we go, through that
valley of death where the heavy charging had
been done, and thousands of men had been
swept away, line after line, in the mad and
furious tempest of the battle. Heavy mists
still overhang the field, even dumb Nature
seeming to be in sympathy with the scene,
while all around us, as we march along, are
sights at which the most callous turn faint.
Interesting enough we find the evidences
of conflict, save only where human life is
concerned.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">On the March to and from Gettysburg.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>We stop to wonder at the immense furrow
yonder which some shell has ploughed up in
the ground; we call one another's attention to
a caisson shivered to atoms by an explosion, or
to a tree cut clean off by a solid shot, or bored
through and through by a shell. With pity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
we contemplate the poor artillery-horses hobbling,
wounded and mangled, about the field,
and we think it a mercy to shoot them as we
pass. But the dead men! Hundreds of torn
and distorted bodies yet on the field, although
thousands already lie buried in the trenches.
Even the roughest and rudest among us
marches awed and silent, as he is forced to
think of the terrible suffering endured in this
place, and of the sorrow and tears there will
be among the mountains of the North and
the rice-fields of the far-off South.</p>

<p>We were quiet, I remember, very quiet,
as we marched off that great field; and not
only then, but for days afterwards, as we
tramped through the pleasant fields of Maryland.
We had little to say, and we all were
pretty busily thinking. Where were the boys
who, but a week before, had marched with us
through those same fragrant fields, blithe as a
sunshiny morn in May? And so, as I have
told you, when those young ladies and gentlemen
came out to the end of that Maryland
village to meet and cheer us after the battle,
as they had met and cheered us before it, we
did not know how heavy-hearted we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
until, in response to their song of "Rally
round the Flag, Boys!" some one proposed
three cheers for them. But the cheers would
not come. Somehow, after the first hurrah,
the other two stuck in our throats or died
away soundless on the air. And so we only
said: "God bless you, young friends; but we
can't cheer to-day, you see!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="medium">THROUGH "MARYLAND, MY MARYLAND."</span></h2>

<p>Our course now lay through Maryland, and
we performed endless marches and countermarches
over turnpikes and through field and
forest.</p>

<p>After crossing South Mountain,&mdash;but stop,
I just <em>must</em> tell you about that, it will take
but a paragraph or two. South Mountain
Pass we entered one July evening, after a
drenching rain, on the Middletown side, and
marched along through that deep mountain
gorge, with a high cliff on either side, and a
delightful stream of fresh water flowing along
the road; emerging on the other side at the
close of day. Breaking off the line of march
by the right flank, we suddenly crossed the
stream, and were ordered up the mountain-side
in the gathering darkness. We climbed very
slowly at first, and more slowly still as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
darkness deepened and the path grew steeper
and more difficult. At about nine o'clock,
orders were given to "sleep on arms," and
then, from sheer fatigue, we all fell sound
asleep, some lying on the rocks, some sitting
bolt upright against the trees, some stretched
out at full length on beds of moss or clumps
of bushes.</p>

<p>What a magnificent sight awaited us the
next morning! Opening our eyes at peep o'
day, we found ourselves high up on top of a
mountain-bluff overlooking the lovely valley
about Boonesboro. The rains were past; the
sun was just beginning to break through the
clouds; great billows of mist were rolling up
from the hollows below, where we could catch
occasional glimpses of the movements of
troops,&mdash;cavalry dashing about in squads, and
infantry marching in solid columns. What
may have been the object of sending us up
that mountain, or what the intention in ordering
us to fell the trees from the mountain-top
and build breastworks hundreds of feet above
the valley, I have never learned. That one
morning amid the mists of the mountain, and
that one grand view of the lovely valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
beneath, were to my mind sufficient reason
for being there.</p>

<p>Refreshed by a day's rest on the mountain-top,
we march down into the valley on the
10th, exhilarated by the sweet, fresh mountain
air, as well as by the prospect, as we suppose,
of a speedy end being put to this cruel
war. For we know that the enemy is somewhere
crossing the swollen Potomac back into
Virginia, in a crippled condition, and we are
sure he will be finally crushed in the next
great battle, which cannot now be many
hours distant. And so we march leisurely
along, over turnpikes and through grain-fields,
on the edge of one of which, by and by, we
halt in line of battle, stack arms, and, with
three cheers, rush in a line for a stake-and-rider
fence, with the rails of which we are to
build breastworks. It is wonderful how rapidly
that Maryland farmer's fence disappears!
Each man seizing a rail, the fence literally
walks off, and in less than fifteen minutes it
reappears in the shape of a compact and well-built
line of breastworks.</p>

<p>But scarcely is the work completed when we
are ordered into the road again, and up this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
we advance a half-mile or so, and form in
line on the left of the road and on the skirt
of another wheat-field. We are about to
stack arms and build a second line of works,
when&mdash;</p>

<p>Z-i-p! z-i-p! z-i-p!</p>

<p>Ah! It is music we know right well by
this time! Three light puffs of smoke rise
yonder in the wheat-field, a hundred yards or
so away, where the enemy's pickets are lying
concealed in the tall grain. Three balls go
singing merrily over my head&mdash;intended, no
doubt, for the lieutenant, who is acting-adjutant,
and who rides immediately in front of
me, with a bandage over his forehead, but who
is too busy forming the line to give much heed
to his danger.</p>

<p>"We'll take you out o' that grass a-hopping,
you long-legged rascals!" shouts Pointer, as
the command is given:</p>

<p>"Deploy to right and left as skirmishers,"&mdash;while
a battery of artillery is brought up
at a gallop, and the guns are trained on a
certain red barn away across the field, from
which the enemy's sharpshooters are picking
off our men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Bang! Hur-r-r! Boom! One, two, three,
four shells go crashing through the red barn,
while the shingles and boards fly like feathers,
and the sharpshooters pour out from it in
wild haste. The pickets are popping away at
one another out there along the field and in
the edge of the wood beyond; the enemy is
driven in and retreats, but we do not advance,
and the expected battle does not come off
after all, as we had hoped it would. For in
the great war-council held about that time, as
we afterwards learned, our generals, by a close
vote, have decided not to risk a general
engagement, but to let the enemy get back
into Virginia again, crippled, indeed, but not
crushed, as every man in the ranks believes
he well might be.</p>

<p>As we step on the swaying pontoons to
recross the Potomac into old Virginia, there
are murmurs of disappointment all along the
line.</p>

<p>"Why didn't they let us fight? We could
have thrashed them now, if ever we could.
We are tired of this everlasting marching and
countermarching up and down, and we want
to fight it out and be done with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
But for all our feelings and wishes, we are
back again on the south side of the river, and
the column of blue soon is marching along
gayly enough among the hills and pleasant
fields about Waterford.</p>

<p>We did not go very fast nor very far those
hot July days, because we had very little to
eat. Somehow or other our provision trains
had lost their reckoning, and in consequence
we were left to subsist as best we could. We
were a worn, haggard-looking, hungry, ragged
set of men. As for me&mdash;out at knee and
elbow, my hair sticking out in tufts through
holes in the top of my hat, my shoes in
shreds, and my haversack empty&mdash;I must
have presented a forlorn appearance indeed.
Fortunately, however, blackberries were ripe
and plentiful. All along the road and all
through the fields, as we approached Warrenton,
these delicious berries hung on the vines
in great luscious clusters. Yet blackberries
for supper and blackberries for breakfast give
a man but little strength for marching under
a July sun all day long. So Corporal Harter
and I thought, as we sat one morning
in a clover-field where we were resting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the day, busy boiling a chicken at our camp-fire.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that chicken, Corporal?"
said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Harry, I didn't steal her,
and I didn't buy her, neither. Late last
night, while we were crossing that creek, I
heard some fellow say he had carried that old
chicken all day since morning, and she was
getting too heavy for him, and he was going
to throw her into the creek; and so I said I'd
take her, and I did, and carried her all night,
and here she is now in the pan, sizzling
away, Harry."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Corporal, this is a fowl trick."</p>

<p>"Fair or fowl, we'll have a good dinner,
any way."</p>

<p>With an appetite ever growing keener as
we caught savory whiffs from the steaming
mess-pan, we piled up the rails on the fire
and boiled the biddy, and boiled, and boiled,
and boiled her from morn till noon, and from
noon to night, and couldn't eat her then, she
was so tough!</p>

<p>"May the dogs take the old grizzle-gizzard!
I'm not going to break my teeth on this old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
buzzard any more," shouted the corporal, as
he flung the whole cartilaginous mass into a
pile of brush near by. "It <em>was</em> a fowl trick,
after all, Harry, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Thus it chanced that, when we marched
out of Warrenton early one sultry summer
morning, we started with empty stomachs and
haversacks, and marched on till noon with
nothing to eat. Halting then in a wood, we
threw ourselves under the trees, utterly
exhausted. About three o'clock, as we lay
there, a whole staff of officers came riding
down the line&mdash;the quartermaster-general
of the Army of the Potomac and staff, they
said it was. Just the very man we wanted to
see! Then broke forth such a yell from
hundreds of famished men as the quartermaster-general
had probably never heard
before nor ever wished to hear again:</p>

<p>"Hard-tack!"</p>

<p>"Coffee!"</p>

<p>"Pork!"</p>

<p>"Beef!"</p>

<p>"Sugar!"</p>

<p>"Salt!"</p>

<p>"Pepper!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
"Hard-tack! Hard-tack!"</p>

<p>The quartermaster and staff put their
spurs to their horses and dashed away in a
cloud of dust, and at last, about nightfall, we
got something to eat.</p>

<p>By the way, this reminds me of an incident
that occurred on one of our long marches;
and I tell it just to show what sometimes is
the effect of short rations.</p>

<p>It was while we were lying up at Chancellorsville
in an immense forest that our supply
of pork and hard-tack began to give out. We
had, indeed, carried with us into the woods
eight full days' rations in our knapsacks and
haversacks; but it rained in torrents for
several days, so that our hard-tack became
mouldy, the roads were impassable, transportation
was out of the question, and we were
forced to put ourselves on short allowance.</p>

<p>"I wish I had some meat, Harry," said
Pete Grove, anxiously inspecting the contents
of his haversack; "I'm awful hungry for
meat."</p>

<p>"Well, Pete," said I, "I saw some jumping
around here pretty lively a while ago. Maybe
you could catch it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
"<em>Meat</em> jumping around here? Why what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why frogs, to be sure&mdash;frogs, Pete. Did
you never eat frogs?"</p>

<p>"Bah! I think I'd be a great deal hungrier
than I am now, ever to eat a frog! Ugh!
No, indeed! But where is he? I'd like the
fun of hunting him, anyhow."</p>

<p>So saying, he loaded his revolver, and we
sallied forth along the stream, and Pete, who
was a good marksman, in a short time had
laid out Mr. Froggy at the first shot.</p>

<p>"Now, Pete, we'll skin him, and you shall
have a feast fit for a king."</p>

<p>So, putting the meat into a tin cup with a
little water, salt, and pepper, boiling it for a
few minutes, and breaking some hard-tack
into it when done, I set it before him. I need
hardly say that when he had once tasted the
dish he speedily devoured it, and when he
had devoured it, he took his revolver in hand
again, and hunted frogs for the rest of that
afternoon.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>Drum and fife have more to do with the
discipline of an army than an inexperienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
person would imagine. The drum is the
tongue of the camp. It wakes the men in
the morning, mounts the guard, announces
the dinner-hour, gives a peculiar charm to
dress-parade in the evening, and calls the
men to quarters with its pleasant tattoo at
night. For months, however, we had had no
drums. Ours had been lost, with our knapsacks,
at Gettysburg. [And I will here pause
to say that if any good friend across the
border has in his possession a snare-drum
with the name and regiment of the writer
clearly marked on the inside of the body, and
will return the same to the owner thereof, he
will confer no small favor, and will be overwhelmed
with an ocean of thanks!]</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">"I've got Him, Boys!"</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>We did not know how really important a
thing a drum is until, one late September
day, we were ordered to prepare for a dress-parade&mdash;a
species of regimental luxury in
which we had not indulged since the early
days of June.</p>

<p>"Major, you don't expect us drummer-boys
to turn out, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And why not, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Why, we have no drums, Major!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
"Well, your fifers have fifes, haven't they?
We'll do without the drums; but you must
all turn out, and the fifers can play."</p>

<p>So when we stood drawn up in line on the
parade-ground among the woods, and the
order was given:</p>

<p>"Parade rest! Troop, beat off!"</p>

<p>Out we drummers and fifers wheeled from
the head of the line, with three shrill fifes
screaming out the rolls, and started at a slow
march down the line, while every man in the
ranks grinned, and we drummer-boys laughed,
and the officers joined us, until at last the
whole line, officers and men alike, broke out
into loud haw-haws at the sight. The fifers
couldn't whistle for laughing, and the major
ordered us all back to our places when only
half down the line, and never even attempted
another parade until a full supply of brand-new
drums arrived for us from Washington.</p>

<p>Then the major picked out mine for me, I
remember, and it proved to be the best in
the lot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="medium">PAINS AND PENALTIES.</span></h2>

<p>Among all civilized nations the "rules of
war" seem to have been written with an iron
hand. The laws by which the soldier in the
field is governed are of necessity inexorable,
for strict discipline is the chief excellence of
an army, and a ready obedience the chief
virtue of the soldier. Nothing can be more
admirable in the character of the true soldier
than his prompt and unquestioning response
to the trumpet-call of duty. The world can
never forget, nor ever sufficiently admire, a
Leonidas with his three hundred Spartans at
Thermopylæ, the Roman soldier on guard at
the gates of the perishing Pompeii, or the
gallant six hundred charging into the "valley
of death" at Balaklava. Disobedience to
orders is the great sin of the soldier, and one
that is sure to be punished, for at no other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
time does Justice wear so stern and severe a
look as when she sits enthroned amidst the
camps of armed men.</p>

<p>In different sections of the army, various
expedients were resorted to for the purpose of
correcting minor offences. What particular
shape the punishment should assume depended
very much upon the inventive faculty of the
Field and Staff, or of such officers of the line
as might have charge of the case.</p>

<p>Before taking the field, a few citizen sneak-thieves
were discovered prowling amongst the
tents. These were promptly drummed out of
camp to the tune of the "Rogue's March,"
the whole regiment shouting in derision as
the miserable fellows took to their heels
when the procession reached the limits of the
camp, where they were told to begone and
never show their faces in camp any more, on
pain of a more severe treatment.</p>

<div><a name="drumming_sneak_thieves_out_of_camp" id="drumming_sneak_thieves_out_of_camp"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i172.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Drumming Sneak-Thieves out of Camp.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>If, as very seldom happened, it was an
enlisted man who was caught stealing, he
was often punished in the following way: A
barrel, having one end knocked out and a
hole in the other large enough to allow one's
head to go through, was slipped over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
culprit's shoulders. On the outside of the
barrel the word THIEF! was printed in large
letters. In this dress he presented the ludicrous
appearance of an animated meal-barrel;
for you could see nothing of him but his head
and legs, his hands being very significantly
confined. Sometimes he was obliged to stand
or sit (as best he could) about the guard-house,
or near by the colonel's quarters, all
day long. At other times he was compelled
to march through the company streets and
make the tour of the camp under guard.</p>

<p>Once in the field, however, sneak-thieves
soon disappeared. Nor was there frequent
occasion to punish the men for any other
offences. Nearly, if not quite all of the punishments
inflicted in the field were for
disobedience in some form or other. Not
that the men were wilfully disobedient. Far
from it. They knew very well that they
must obey, and that the value of their services
was measured wholly by the quality of their
obedience. It very rarely happened, even
amid the greatest fatigue after a hard day's
march, or in the face of the most imminent
danger, that any one refused his duty. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
after a long and severe march, a man is so
completely exhausted that he is likely to
become irritable and to manifest a temper
quite foreign to his usual habit. He is then
not himself, and may in such circumstances
do what at other times he would not think
of doing.</p>

<p>Thus it once happened in my own company
that one of the boys took it into his head to
kick over the traces. We had had a long hot
day's march through Maryland on the way
down from Gettysburg, and were quite worn
out. About midnight we halted in a clover
field on a hillside for rest and sleep. Corporal
Harter, who was the only officer, commissioned
or non-commissioned, that we had
left to us after Gettysburg, called out:</p>

<p>"John D&mdash;&mdash;, report to the adjutant for
camp guard."</p>

<p>Now John, who was a German, by the
way, did not like the prospect of losing his
sleep, and had to be summoned a second time
before replying:</p>

<p>"Corporal, ich thu's es net!" (Corporal, I
won't do it.)</p>

<p>Tired though we all were, we could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
help laughing at the preposterous idea of a
man daring to disobey the corporal. As the
boys jerked off their accoutrements and began
to spread down their gum-blankets on the
fragrant clover wet with the dew, they were
greatly amused at this singular passage between
John and the corporal.</p>

<p>"Come on, John. Don't make a Dutch
dunce of yourself. You know you <em>must</em> go."</p>

<p>"Ich hab' dir g'sawt, ich thu's es net" (I
have told you I won't do it), insisted John.</p>

<p>"Pitch in, John!" shouted some one from
his bed in the clover. "Give it to him in
Dutch; that'll fetch him."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it!" said the corporal. "Come
on, man. What do you mean? You know
you've got to go."</p>

<p>"Ich hab' dir zwei mohl g'sawt, ich thu's
es gar net" (I have told you twice that I will
certainly not do it).</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! It beats the Dutch!" said some
one.</p>

<p>"Something rotten in Denmark!" exclaimed
another.</p>

<p>"Put him in the guard-house!" suggested
a third from under his gum-blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
"Plague take the thing!" said the corporal,
perplexed. "Pointer," continued he, "put on
your accoutrements again, get your gun, and
take John under arrest to the adjutant."</p>

<p>"Come on, John," said Pointer, buckling
on his belt, "and be mighty quick about it
too. I don't want to stand about here arguing
all night; I want to get to roost. Come
along!"</p>

<p>The men leaned up on their elbows in their
beds on the clover, interested in knowing how
John would take <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, scratching his head and
taking his gun in hand, "Corporal, ich glaub'
ich det besser geh" (Corporal, I guess I'd
better go).</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pointer with a drawl, "I guess
you 'besser' had, or the major'll make short
work with you and your Dutch. What in the
name of General Jackson did you come to the
army for, if you ain't a-going to obey orders?"</p>

<p>If while we were lying in camp a man
refused his duty, he was at once haled to the
guard-house, which is the military name for
lock-up. Once there, at the discretion of the
officers, he was either simply confined and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
put on bread and water, or maybe ordered to
carry a log of wood, or a knapsack filled with
stones, "two hours on and two off," day and
night, until such time as he was deemed to
have done sufficient penance. In more extreme
cases a court-martial was held, and
the penalty of forfeiture of all pay due, with
hard labor for thirty days, or the like, was
inflicted.</p>

<p>"Tying up by the thumb" was sometimes
adopted. Down in front of Petersburg, out
along the Weldon Railroad, I once saw thirteen
colored soldiers tied up by their thumbs at a
time. Between two pine-saplings a long pole
had been thrown across and fastened at either
end about seven feet from the ground. To
this pole thirteen ropes had been attached at
regular intervals, and to each rope a darky
was tied by the thumb in such a way that he
could just touch the ground with his heel and
keep the rope taut. If any one will try the
experiment of holding up his arm in such a
position for only five minutes, he will appreciate
the force of the punishment of being
tied up by the thumbs for a half day.</p>

<p>In some regiments they had a high wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
horse, which the offender was made to mount;
and there he was kept for hours in a seat as
conspicuous as it was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>One day, down in front of Petersburg, a
number of us had been making a friendly call
on some acquaintances over in another regiment.
As we were returning home we came
across what we took to be a well, and wishing
a drink we all stopped. The well in question,
as was usual there, was nothing but a barrel
sunk in the ground; for at some places the
ground was so full of springs that, in order to
get water, all you had to do was to sink a box
or barrel, and the water would collect of its
own accord. Stooping down and looking into
the well in question, Andy discovered a man
standing in the well and bailing out the
water.</p>

<p>"What's he doing down there in that
hole?" asked some one of our company.</p>

<p>"He says he's in the gopher-hole," said
Andy, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Gopher-hole! What's a gopher-hole!"</p>

<p>"Why," said the guard, who was standing
near by, and whom we had taken for the
customary guard on the spring, "you see,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
comrades, our colonel has his own way of
punishin' the boys. One thing he won't let
'em do&mdash;he won't let 'em get drunk. They
may drink as much as they want, but they
must not get drunk. If they do, they go into
the gopher-hole. Jim, there, is in the gopher-hole
now. That hole has a spring in the
bottom, and the water comes in pretty fast;
and if Jim wants to keep dry he's got to keep
dippin' all the time, or else stand in the water
up to his neck&mdash;and Jim isn't so mighty
fond o' water neither."</p>

<p>Late in the fall of 1863, while we were
lying in camp somewhere among the pine
woods along the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad, we were one day marched out to
witness the execution of a deserter. Instances
of desertion to the enemy's lines were extremely
rare with us; but whenever they
occurred, the unfortunate offenders, if caught,
were dealt with in the most summary manner,
for the doom of the deserter is death.</p>

<p>The poor fellow who was to suffer the
highest penalty of military law on the present
occasion was, we were informed, a Maryland
boy. Some months previously he had deserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
his regiment for some cause or other,
and had gone over to the enemy. Unfortunately
for him it happened that in one of the
numerous skirmishes we were engaged in
about that time, he was taken prisoner, in
company with a number of Confederate soldiers.
Unfortunately, also, for the poor
fellow, it chanced that he was captured by
the very company from which he had deserted.
The disguise of a Confederate uniform, which
might have stood him in good stead had he
fallen into any other hands, was now of no
avail. He was at once recognized by his former
comrades in arms, tried by court-martial,
found guilty, and sentenced to be shot.</p>

<p>So, one October morning, orders came to
the effect that the whole division was to turn
out at one o'clock, to witness the execution of
the sentence. I need hardly say that this
was most unwelcome news. Nobody wished
to see so sad a sight. Some of the men
begged to be excused from attendance, and
others could not be found when our drums
beat the "assembly;" for none could well
endure, as they said, "to see a man shot
down like a dog." It was one thing to shoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
a fellow mortal, or to see him shot, in battle;
but this was quite a different thing. A squad
of men had been detailed to shoot the poor
fellow, Elias Foust, of our company, being
among the number. But Elias, to his credit
be it recorded, begged off, and had some one
else appointed in his stead. One could not
help but pity the men who were assigned to
this most unpleasant duty, for if it be painful
only to see a man shot, what must it not be
to shoot him with your own hand? However,
in condescension to this altogether natural
and humane aversion to the shedding of
blood, and in order to render the task as
endurable as possible, the customary practice
was observed:&mdash;On the morning of the execution
an officer, who had been appointed for
the purpose, took a number of rifles, some
twelve or fourteen in number, and loaded all
of them carefully with powder and ball, <em>except
one</em>, this one being loaded with blank cartridge,
that is, with powder only. He then
mixed the guns so thoroughly that he himself
could scarcely tell which guns were loaded
with ball and which one was not. Another
officer then distributed the guns to the men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
not one of whom could be at all certain
whether his particular gun contained a ball or
not, and all of whom could avail themselves
of the full benefit of the doubt in the case.</p>

<p>It was one of those peculiarly impressive
autumn days when all that one sees or hears
conspires to fill the mind with an indefinable
feeling of sadness. There was the chirp of
the cricket in the air, and the far-away chorus
of the myriads of insects complaining that the
year was done. There was all the impressiveness
of a dull sky, a dreamy haze over the
field, a yellow and brown tinge on the forest,
accompanied by that peculiarly mournful wail
of the breeze as it sighed and moaned dolefully
among the branches of the pines,&mdash;all
joining in chanting a requiem, it seemed to
me, for the poor Maryland boy whose sands
were fast running out.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the division marched
out and took position in a large field, or
clearing, surrounded on all sides by pine-woods.
We were drawn up so as to occupy
three sides of a great hollow square, two
ranks deep and facing inward, the fourth side
of the square (where we could see that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
grave had been recently dug) being left open
for the execution. Scarcely were we well in
position, when there came to our ears, wafted
by the sighing autumn wind, the mournful
notes of the "Dead March." Looking away
in the direction whence the music came, we
could see a long procession marching sadly and
slowly to the measured stroke of the muffled
drum. First came the band, playing the
dirge; next, the squad of executioners; then
a pine coffin, carried by four men; then the
prisoner himself, dressed in black trousers
and white shirt, and marching in the midst
of four guards; then a number of men under
arrest for various offences, who had been
brought out for the sake of the moral effect it
was hoped this spectacle might have upon
them. Last of all came a strong guard.</p>

<p>When the procession had come up to the
place where the division was formed, and
had reached the open side of the hollow
square, it wheeled to the left and marched all
along the inside of the line from the right
to the left, the band still playing the dirge.
The line was long and the step was slow, and
it seemed that they never would get to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
other end. But at long last, after having
solemnly traversed the entire length of the
three sides of the hollow square, the procession
came to the open side of it, opposite to
the point from which it had started. The
escort wheeled off. The prisoner was placed
before his coffin, which was set down in front
of his grave. The squad of twelve or fourteen
men who were to shoot the unfortunate man
took position some ten or twelve yards from
the grave, facing the prisoner, and a chaplain
stepped out from the group of division officers
near by, and prayed with and for the poor
fellow a long, long time. Then the bugle
sounded. The prisoner, standing proudly
erect before his grave, had his eyes bandaged,
and calmly folded his arms across his breast.
The bugle sounded again. The officer in
charge of the squad stepped forward. Then
we heard the command, given as calmly as if
on drill,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ready!"</p>

<p>"Aim!"</p>

<p>Then, drowning out the third command,
"Fire!" came a flash of smoke and a loud
report. The surgeons ran up to the spot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
The bands and drum-corps of the division
struck up a quick-step as the division faced to
the right and marched past the grave, in order
that in the dead form of its occupant we
might all see that the doom of the deserter is
death. It was a sad sight. As we moved
along, many a rough fellow, from whom you
would hardly have expected any sign of pity,
pretending to be adjusting his cap so as to
screen his eyes from the glare of the westering
sun, could be seen furtively drawing his hand
across his face and dashing away the tears
that could not be kept from trickling down
the bronzed and weather-beaten cheek. As we
marched off the field, we could not help being
sensible of the harsh contrast between the
lively music to which our feet were keeping
step, and the fearfully solemn scene we had
just witnessed. The transition from the
"Dead March" to the quick-step was quite
too sudden. A deep solemnity pervaded the
ranks as we marched homeward across the
open field and into the sombre pine-woods
beyond, thinking, as we went, of the poor
fellow's home somewhere among the pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
hills of Maryland, and of the sad and heavy
hearts there would be there when it was
known that he had paid the extreme penalty
of the law.</p>

<span class="medium">A TALE OF A SQUIRREL AND THREE</span><br />
<span class="medium">BLIND MICE.</span></h2>

<p>"Andy, what is a shade-tail?"</p>

<p>We were encamped in an oak-forest on the
eastern bank of the Rappahannock, late in the
fall of 1863. We had built no winter-quarters
yet, although the nights were growing rather
frosty, and had to content ourselves with our
little "dog-tents," as we called our shelters,
some dozen or so of which now constituted our
company row. I had just come in from a trip
through the woods in quest of water at a
spring near an old deserted log-house about
a half-mile to the south of our camp, when,
throwing down my heavy canteens, I made
the above interrogatory of my chum.</p>

<p>Andy was lazily lying at full length on his
back in the tent, reclining on a soft bed of
pine-branches, or "Virginia feathers," as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
called them, with his hands clasped behind
his head, lustily singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Tramp, tramp, tramp! the boys are marching!</div>
<div class="line i0h">Cheer up, comrades, they will come!</div>
<div class="line i0h">And beneath the starry flag</div>
<div class="line i0h">We shall breathe the air again&mdash;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"What's that?" asked he, ceasing his song
before finishing the stanza, and rising up on
his elbow.</p>

<p>"I asked whether you could tell me what a
shade-tail is?"</p>

<p>"A shade-tail! Never heard of it before.
Don't believe there is any such thing. I
know what a buck-tail is, though. There's
one," said he, pulling a fine specimen out
from under his knapsack. "That just came
in the mail while you were gone. The old
buck that chased the flies with that brush for
many a year was shot up among the Buffalo
mountains last winter, and my father bought
his tail of the man who killed him, and has
sent it to me. It cost him just one dollar."</p>

<p>Buck-tails were in great demand with us in
those days, and happy indeed was the man
who could secure so fine a specimen as Andy
now proudly held in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
"But isn't it rather large?" inquired I.
"And it's nearly all white, and would make
an excellent mark for some Johnny to shoot
at, eh?"</p>

<p>"Never you fear for that. 'Old Trusty'
up there," said he, pointing to his gun hanging
along underneath the ridge-pole of the
tent,&mdash;"'Old Trusty' and I will take care of
Johnny Reb."</p>

<p>"But, Andy," continued I, "you haven't answered
my question yet. What is a shade-tail?"</p>

<p>"A shade-tail," said he, meditatively,&mdash;"how
should I know? I know precious well
what a <em>detail</em> is, though; and I'm on one
for to-morrow. We go across the river to
throw up breastworks."</p>

<p>"I forgot," said I, "that you have not
studied Greek to any extent yet. If you live
to get home and go back to school again at
the old Academy, and begin to dig Greek roots
in earnest, you will find that a shade-tail is a&mdash;squirrel.
For that is what the old Greeks
called the bonny bush-tail. Because, don't
you see, when a squirrel sits up on a tree with
his tail turned up over his back, he makes a
shade for himself with his tail, and sits, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
were, under the shadow of his own vine and
fig-tree."</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy, "and what if he does?
What's to hinder him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered I, entering the tent
and lying down beside him on the pile of Virginia
feathers; "only I saw one out here in
the woods as I came along, and I think I know
where his nest is; and if you and I can catch
him, or, what would be better still, if we can
capture one of his young ones (if he has any),
why we might tame him and keep him for a
pet. I've often thought it would be a fine
thing for us to have a pet of some kind or
other. Over in the Second Division, there is
one regiment that has a pet crow, and another
has a kitten. They go with the men on all
their marches, and they say that the kitten
has actually been wounded in battle, and no
doubt will be taken or sent up North some
day and be a great curiosity. Now why
couldn't we catch and tame a shade-tail?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Andy, becoming a little interested;
"he could be taught to perch on
Pointer's buck-horns in camp, and could ride
on your drum on the march."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Pointer, you must know, was the tallest man
in the company, and therefore stood at the
head of the line when the company was
formed. When we enlisted, he brought with
him a pair of deer-antlers as an appropriate
symbol for a Buck-tail company,&mdash;no doubt
with the intention of making both ends meet.
Now the idea of having a live tame squirrel
to perch on Pointer's buck-horns was a capital
one indeed.</p>

<p>But as the first thing to be done in cooking
a hare is to catch the hare, so we concluded
that the first thing to be done in
taming a squirrel was to catch the squirrel.
This gave us a world of thought. It would
not do to shoot him. We could not trap him.
After discussing the merits of smoking him
out of his hole, we determined at last to risk
cutting down the tree in which he had his
home, and trying to catch him in a bag.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when we thought he would
likely be at home taking a nap, having provided
ourselves with an axe, an old oat-bag,
and a lot of tent rope, we cautiously proceeded
to the old beech-tree on the outskirts of the
camp, where our intended pet had his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
"Now, you see, Andy," said I, pointing
up to a crotch in the tree, "up there is his
front door; there he goes out and comes
in. My plan is this: one of us must climb
the tree and tie the mouth of the bag over
that hole somehow, and come down. Then
we will cut the tree down, and when it falls,
if old shade-tail is at home, like as not he'll
run into the bag; and then, if we can be
quick enough, we can tie a string around the
bag, and there he is!"</p>

<p>Andy climbed the tree and tied the bag.
After he had descended, we set vigorously to
work at cutting down the beech. It took us
about half an hour to make any serious inroad
upon the tough trunk. But by and by we
had the satisfaction of seeing the tree apparently
shiver under our blows, and at last
down it came with a crash.</p>

<p>We both ran toward the bag as fast as we
could, ready to secure our prize; but we
found, alas! that squirrels sometimes have
two doors to their houses, and that while we
had hoped to bag our bush-tail at the front
door, he had merrily skipped out the back
way. For scarcely had the tree reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
ground, when we both beheld our intended pet
leaping out of the branches and running up
a neighboring tree as fast as his legs could
carry him.</p>

<p>"Plague take it!" said Andy, wiping the
perspiration from his face, "what shall we do
now? I guess you'd better run to camp and
get a little salt to throw on his tail."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said I, "we'11 get him yet,
see if we don't. I see him up there behind
that old dry limb peeping out at us&mdash;there
he goes!"</p>

<p>Sure enough, there he did go, from tree-top
to tree-top, "lickerty-skoot," as Andy afterward
expressed it, and we after him, quite
losing our heads, and shouting like Indians.</p>

<p>As ill luck would have it, our shade-tail
was making straight for the camp, on the
outskirts of which he was discovered by one
of the men, who instantly gave the alarm&mdash;"A squirrel!
a squirrel!" In a moment all
the boys in camp not on duty came running
pell-mell, Sergeant Kensill's black-and-tan
terrier, Little Jim (of whom more anon),
leading the way. I suppose there must have
been about a hundred men together, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
yelling and shouting too, so that the poor
squirrel checked his headlong course high up
on the dead limb of a great old oak-tree.
Then, forming a circle around the tree, with
"Little Jim" in the midst, the boys began to
shout and yell as when on the charge,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yi-yi-yi! Yi-yi-yi!"</p>

<p>Whereat the poor squirrel was so terrified,
that, leaping straight up and out from his
perch into open space, in sheer affright and
despair, down he came tumbling tail over
head into the midst of the circle, which
rapidly closed about him as he neared the
ground. With yells and cheers that made
the wood ring, a hundred hands were
stretched out as if to catch him as he came
down. But Little Jim beat them all. True
to his terrier blood and training, he suddenly
leaped up like a shot, seized the squirrel by
the nape of the neck, gave him a few angry
shakes, which ended his agony, and carried
him off triumphantly in his mouth to the tent
of his owner, Sergeant Kensill, of Company F.</p>

<p>That evening, as we sat in our tent eating
our fried hard-tack, Andy remarked, while
sipping his coffee from his black tin cup, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
if buck-tails were as hard to catch as shade-tails,
they were well worth a dollar apiece any
day; and that he believed a crow, or one of
those young pigs we found running wild in
the woods when we came to that camp, or
something of that sort, would make a better
pet than a squirrel.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "we caught those pigs,
anyhow, didn't we? But didn't they squeal!
Fortunately they were so much like oysters
that they couldn't get away from us, and all
found their way into our frying-pans at last."</p>

<p>"I fail to apprehend your meaning," said
Andy, with mock gravity, setting down his
black tin cup on the gum-blanket. "By what
right or authority, sir, do you presume to tell
me that a pig is like an oyster?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see? A pig is like an
oyster <em>because he can't climb a tree</em>! And
that's the reason why we caught him."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Andy; "that's a miserable
joke, that is."</p>

<p>"Yet you must admit that it is a most
happy circumstance that a pig cannot climb a
tree, or we should have missed more than one
good meal of fresh pork. Yet although we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
failed to make a pet of the squirrel because he
<em>could</em> climb a tree, and of the pig because he
<em>could not</em>, we shall make a pet of something
or other yet. Of that I am certain."</p>

<p>It was some months later, and not until we
were safely established in winter-quarters,
that we finally succeeded in our purpose of
having something to pet. I was over at
Brigade headquarters one day, visiting a
friend who had charge of several supply-wagons.
Being present while he was engaged
in overhauling his stores, I found in the
bottom of a large box, in which blankets had
been packed away, a whole family of mice.
The father of the family promptly made his
escape; the mother was killed in the capture,
and one little fellow was so injured that he
soon died; but the rest, three in number, I
took out unhurt. As I laid them in the palm
of my hand, they at once struck me as perfect
little beauties. They were very young and
quite small, being no larger than the end of
my finger, with scarcely any fur on them, and
their eyes quite shut. Putting them into my
pocket and covering them with some cotton
which my friend gave me, I started home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
with my prize. Stopping at the surgeon's
quarters on reaching camp, I begged a large
empty bottle (which I afterward found had
been lately filled with pulverized gum arabic),
and somewhere secured an old tin can of the
same diameter as the bottle. Then I got a
strong twine, went down to my tent, and
asked Andy to help me make a cage for my
pets, which with pride I took out of my
pocket and set to crawling and nosing about
on the warm blankets on the bunk.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with that
bottle?" inquired Andy.</p>

<p>"Going to cut it in two with this string,"
said I, holding up my piece of twine.</p>

<p>"Can't be done!" asserted he.</p>

<p>"Wait and see," answered I.</p>

<p>Procuring a mess-pan full of cold water, and
placing it on the floor of the tent near the
bunk on which we were sitting, I wound the
twine once around the bottle a few inches
from the bottom, in such a way that Andy
could hold one end of the bottle and pull one
end of the twine one way, while I held the
other end of the bottle and pulled the other
end of the twine the other way, thus causing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the twine, by means of its rapid friction, to
heat the bottle in a narrow, straight line all
around. After sawing away in this style for
several minutes, I suddenly plunged the
bottle into the pan of cold water, when it at
once snapped in two along the line where the
twine had passed around it, and as clean and
clear as if it had been cut by a diamond.
Then, melting off the top of the old tin can by
holding it in the fire, I fastened the body of
the can on the lower end of the bottle. When
finished, the whole arrangement looked like
a large long bottle, the upper part of which
was glass and the lower tin. In this way I
accomplished the double purpose of providing
my pets with a dark chamber and a well-lighted
apartment, at the same time preventing
them from running away. Placing some
cotton on the inside of both can and bottle for
a bed, and thrusting a small sponge moistened
with sweetened water into the neck of the
bottle, I then put my pets into their new
home. Of course they could not see, for their
eyes were not yet open; neither did they at
first seem to know how to eat; but as necessity
is the mother of invention with mice as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
well as with men, they soon learned to toddle
forward to the neck of the bottle and suck
their sweet sponge. In a short time they
learned also to nibble at a bit of apple, and
by and by could crunch their hard-tack like
veritable veterans.</p>

<p>The bottle, as has already been said, had
been filled with pulverized gum arabic. Some
of this still adhering to the inside of the bottle,
was gradually brushed off by their growing
fur; and it was amusing to see the little things
sit on their haunches and clean themselves of
the sticky substance. Sometimes they would
all three be busy at the same time, each at
himself; and again two of them would take to
licking the third, rubbing their little red noses
all over him from head to tail in the most
amusing way imaginable.</p>

<p>Gradually they grew very lively, and became
quite tame, so that we could take them out of
their house into our hands, and let them hunt
about in our pockets for apple-seeds or pieces
of hard-tack. We called them Jack, Jill, and
Jenny, and they seemed to know their names.
When let out of their cage occasionally for a
romp on the blankets, they would climb over
everything, running along the inner edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the eave-boards and the ridge-pole, but never
succeeded in getting away from us. It was a
comical sight to see Little Jim come in to
look at them. A mouse was almost the highest
possible excitement to Jim; for a mouse
was second cousin to a rat, no doubt, as Jim
looked at matters; and just say "rats!" to
Jim, if you wanted to see him jump! He
would come in and look at our pets, turn his
head from one side to the other, and wrinkle
his brow, and whine and bark; but we were determined
he should not kill our mousies as he
had killed our shade-tail a few months before.</p>

<p>What to do with our pets when spring came
on and winter-quarters were nearly at an end,
we knew not. We could not take them along
on the march, neither did we like to leave
them behind; for it seemed cruel to leave
Jack, Jill, and Jenny in the deserted and dismantled
camp to go back to the barbarous
habits of their ancestors. On consideration,
therefore, we concluded to take them back to
the wagon train and leave them with the
wagoner, who, though at first he demurred to
our proposal, at last consented to let us turn
them loose among his oat-bags, where I doubt
not they had a merry time indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="medium">"THE PRIDE OF THE REGIMENT."</span></h2>

<p>The pet-making disposition which had led
Andy and me to take so much trouble with
our mice was not confined to ourselves alone.
The disposition was quite natural, and therefore
very general among the men of all commands.
Pets of any and all kinds, whether
chosen from the wild or the domestic animals,
were everywhere in great esteem, and happy
was the regiment which possessed a tame
crow, squirrel, coon, or even a kitten.</p>

<p>Our own regiment possessed a pet of great
value and high esteem in Little Jim, of
whom some incidental mention has already
been made. As Little Jim enlisted with the
regiment, and was honorably mustered out of
the service with it at the close of the war, after
three years of as faithful service as so little
a creature as he could render the flag of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
country, some brief account of him here may
not be out of place.</p>

<p>Little Jim, then, was a small rat-terrier,
of fine-blooded stock, his immediate maternal
ancestor having won a silver collar in a celebrated
rat-pit in Philadelphia. Late in 1859,
while yet a pup, he was given by a sailor
friend to John C. Kensill, with whom he was
mustered into the United States service "for
three years or during the war," on Market
Street, Philadelphia, Pa., late in August, 1862.
Around his neck was a silver collar with the
inscription,&mdash;"Jim Kensill, Co. F., 150th
Regt. P. V."</p>

<p>He soon came to be a great favorite with
the boys, not only of his own company, but of
the entire regiment as well, the men of the
different companies thinking quite as much of
him as if he belonged to each of them individually,
and not to Sergeant Kensill, of Company
F., alone. On the march he would be caught
up from the roadside where he was doggedly
trotting along, and given a ride on the arms of
the men, who would pet him and talk to him
as if he were a child, and not a dog. In winter-quarters,
however, he would not sleep anywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
except on Kensill's arm and underneath
the blankets; nor was he ever known to spend
a night away from home. On first taking the
field, rations were scarce with us, and for several
days fresh meat could not be had for poor
Jim, and he nearly starved. Gradually, however,
his master taught him to take a hard-tack
between his fore-paws, and, holding it there, to
munch and crunch at it till he had consumed
it. He soon learned to like hard-tack, and
grew fat on it too. On the march to Chancellorsville
he was lost for two whole days, to
the great grief of the men. When his master
learned that he had been seen with a neighboring
regiment, he had no difficulty in finding
volunteers to accompany him when he
announced that he was about to set out for the
recapture of Jim. They soon found where he
was. Another regiment had possession of
him, and laid loud and angry claim to him;
but Kensill and his men were not to be frightened,
for he knew the Buck-tails were at his
back, and that sooner than give up Little Jim
there would be some rough work. As soon as
Jim heard his master's sharp whistle, he came
bounding and barking to his side, overjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to be at home again, albeit he had lost his
silver collar, which his thievish captors had
cut from his neck, in order the better to lay
claim to him.</p>

<p>He was a good soldier too, being no coward,
and caring not a wag of his tail for the biggest
shells the Johnnies could toss over at us. He
was with us under our first shell fire at
"Clarke's Mills," a few miles below Fredericksburg,
in May, 1863, and ran barking after
the very first shell that came screaming over
our heads. When the shell had buried itself
in the ground, Jim went up close to it, crouching
down on all fours, while the boys cried
"Rats! rats! Shake him, Jim! Shake him,
Jim!" Fortunately that first shell did not
explode, and when others came that did explode,
Jim, with true military instinct, soon
learned to run after them and bark, but to
keep a respectful distance from them.</p>

<p>On the march to Gettysburg he was with us
all the way, but when we came near the
enemy, his master sent him back to William
Wiggins, the wagoner; for he thought too
much of Jim to run the risk of losing him in
battle. It was a pity Jim was not with us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
out in front of the Seminary the morning of
the first day, when the fight opened; for as
soon as the cannon began to boom, the rabbits
began to run in all directions, as if scared
quite out of their poor little wits; and there
would have been fine sport for Jim with the
cotton-tails, had he only been there to give
them chase.</p>

<p>In the first day's fight Jim's owner, Sergeant
John C. Kensill, while bravely leading
the charge for the recapture of the 149th
Pennsylvania Regiment's battle-flags (of
which some brief account has been elsewhere
given), was wounded and left for dead on the
field, with a bullet through his head. He,
however, so far recovered from his wound
that in the following October he rejoined the
regiment, which was then lying down along
the Rappahannock somewhere. In looking
for the regiment, on his return from a
Northern hospital, Sergeant Kensill chanced
to pass the supply train, and saw Jim busy at a
bone under a wagon. Hearing the old familiar
whistle, Jim at once looked up, saw his
master, left his bone, and came leaping and
barking in greatest delight to his owner's arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
On the march he was sometimes sent back
to the wagon. Once he came near being
killed. To keep him from following the
regiment or from straying and getting lost in
search of it, the wagoner had tied him to the
rear axle of his wagon with a strong twine.
In crossing a stream, in his anxiety to get his
team over safely, the wagoner forgot all about
poor little Jim, who was dragged and slashed
through the waters in a most unmerciful way.
After getting safely over the stream, the teamster,
looking back, found poor Jim under the
rear of the wagon, being dragged along by the
neck, more dead than alive. He was then put
on the sick-list for a few days; but with this
single exception he had never a mishap of any
kind, and was always ready for duty.</p>

<p>His master having been honorably discharged
before the close of the war because
of wounds, Jim was left with the regiment
in care of Wiggins, the wagoner. When the
regiment was mustered out of service at the
end of the war, Little Jim was mustered
out too. He stood up in rank with the boys
and wagged his tail for joy that peace had
come, and that we were all going home. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
understand that his discharge-papers were regularly
made out, the same as those of the men,
and that they read somewhat as follows,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Although not pertaining to the writer's own
personal recollections, there yet may be appropriately
introduced here some brief mention
of another pet, who, from being "the pride of
his regiment," gradually arose to the dignity
of national fame. I mean Old Abe, the war
eagle of the Eighth Wisconsin Volunteers.</p>

<p>Whoever it may have been that first conceived
the idea, it was certainly a happy
thought to make a pet of an eagle. For the
eagle is our national bird, and to carry an
eagle along with the colors of a regiment on
the march, and in battle, and all through
the whole war, was surely very appropriate
indeed.</p>

<p>Old Abe's perch was on a shield, which
was carried by a soldier, to whom, and to
whom alone, he looked as to a master. He
would not allow any one to carry or even to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
handle him except this soldier, nor would he
ever receive his food from any other person's
hands. He seemed to have sense enough to
know that he was sometimes a burden to his
master on the march, however, and as if to
relieve him, would occasionally spread his
wings and soar aloft to a great height, the
men of all regiments along the line of march
cheering him as he went up. He regularly
received his rations from the commissary, the
same as any enlisted man. Whenever fresh
meat was scarce and none could be found for
him by foraging parties, he would take things
into his own claws, as it were, and go out on
a foraging expedition himself. On some such
occasions he would be gone two or three days
at a time, during which nothing whatever was
seen of him; but he would invariably return,
and seldom came back without a young lamb
or a chicken in his talons. His long absences
occasioned his regiment not the slightest concern,
for the men knew that though he might
fly many miles away in quest of food, he would
be quite sure to find them again.</p>

<p>In what way he distinguished the two hostile
armies so accurately that he was never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
once known to mistake the gray for the blue,
no one can tell. But so it was that he was
never known to alight save in his own camp
and amongst his own men.</p>

<p>At Jackson, Mississippi, during the hottest
part of the battle before that city, Old Abe
soared up into the air and remained there from
early morning till the fight closed at night,
having, no doubt, greatly enjoyed his bird's-eye
view of the battle. He did the same at Mission
Ridge. He was, I believe, struck by the
enemy's bullets two or three times; but his
feathers were so thick, that his body was not
much hurt. The shield on which he was
carried, however, showed so many marks of
the enemy's balls, that it looked on top as if
a groove-plane had been run over it.</p>

<p>At the Centennial celebration held in Philadelphia
in 1876, Old Abe occupied a prominent
place on his perch on the west side
of the nave in the Agricultural building.
He was still alive, though evidently growing
old, and was the observed of all observers.
Thousands of visitors from all sections of the
country paid their respects to the grand old
bird, who, apparently conscious of the honors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
conferred upon him, overlooked the sale of his
biography and photographs going on beneath
his perch with entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>As was but just and right, the soldier who
had carried him during the war continued to
have charge of him after the war was over,
until the day of his death, which occurred at
the Capitol of Michigan some two or three
years ago.</p>

<p>Proud as the Wisconsin boys justly were of
Old Abe, the Twelfth Indiana Regiment
possessed a pet of whom it may be truly said
that he enjoyed a renown scarcely second to
that of the wide-famed war eagle. This was
"Little Tommy," as he was familiarly called
in those days,&mdash;the youngest drummer-boy,
and so far as the writer's knowledge goes, the
youngest enlisted man, in the Union Army.
The writer well remembers having seen him
on several occasions. His diminutive size and
childlike appearance, as well as his remarkable
skill and grace in handling the drum-sticks,
never failed to make an impression on the
beholder. Some brief and honorable mention
of Little Tommy, the pride of the Twelfth
Indiana Regiment, may with propriety find a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
place in these "Recollections of a Drummer-Boy."</p>

<p>Thomas Hubler was born in Fort Wayne,
Allen County, Indiana, October 9th, 1851.
When two years of age, the family removed to
Warsaw, Indiana. On the outbreak of the
war, his father, who had been a German
soldier of the truest type, raised a company
of men, in response to President Lincoln's
first call for seventy-five thousand troops.
Little Tommy was among the first to enlist
in his father's company, the date of enrolment
being April 19th, 1861. He was then
nine years and six months old.</p>

<p>The regiment to which the company was
assigned was with the Army of the Potomac
throughout all its campaigns in Maryland and
Virginia. At the expiration of its term of
service in August, 1862, Little Tommy re-enlisted,
and served to the end of the war,
having been present in some twenty-six battles
in all. He was greatly beloved by all the men
of his regiment, and was a constant favorite
amongst them. It is thought that he beat the
first "long roll" of the great Civil War. He
is still living in Warsaw, Indiana, and bids
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
fair to be the latest survivor of the great and
grand army of which he was the youngest
member. With the swift advancing years the
ranks of the soldiers of the late war are being
rapidly thinned out, and those who yet remain
are showing signs of age. The "Boys in
Blue" are thus, as the years go by, almost imperceptibly
turning into the "Boys in Gray;"
and as Little Tommy, the youngest of them
all, sounded their first reveille, so may he yet
live to beat their last tattoo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="medium">AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE.</span></h2>

<p>What glorious camp-fires we used to have
in the fall of the year 1863! It makes one
rub his hands together yet, just to think of
them. The nights were getting cold and
frosty, so that it was impossible to sleep under
our little shelters with comfort; and so half
the night was spent around the blazing fires
at the ends of the company streets.</p>

<p>I always took care that there should be a
blazing good fire for our little company, anyhow.
My duties were light, and left me time,
which I found I could spend with pleasure in
swinging an axe. Hickory and white-oak saplings
were my favorites; and with these cut
into lengths of ten feet, and piled up as high
as my head on wooden fire-dogs, what a glorious
crackle we would have by midnight!
Go out there what time of night you might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
please,&mdash;and you were pretty sure to go out
to the fire three or four times a night, for it
was too bitterly cold to sleep in the tent more
than an hour at a stretch,&mdash;you would always
find a half-dozen of the boys sitting about the
fire on logs, smoking their pipes, telling yarns,
or singing odd catches of song. As I recall
those weird night-scenes of army life,&mdash;the
blazing fire, the groups of swarthy men gathered
about, the thick darkness of the forest,
where the lights and shadows danced and
played all night long, and the rows of little
white tents covered with frost&mdash;it looks quite
poetical in the retrospect; but I fear it was
sometimes prosy enough in the reality.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>"If you fellows would stop your everlasting
arguing there, and go out and bring in some
wood, it would be a good deal better; for if we
don't have a big camp-fire to-night we'll freeze
in this snow-storm."</p>

<p>So saying, Pointer threw down the butt-end
of a pine-sapling he had been half-dragging,
half-carrying out of the woods in the edge of
which we were to camp, and, axe in hand, fell
to work at it with a will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
There was, indeed, some need of following
Pointer's good advice, for it was snowing fast,
and was bitterly cold. It was Christmas Eve,
1863, and here we were, with no protection but
our little shelters, pitched on the hard, frozen
ground.</p>

<p>Why did we not build winter-quarters, do
you ask? Well, we had already built two sets
of winter-quarters, and had been ordered out
of them in both instances, to take part in some
expedition or other; and it was a little hard
to be houseless and homeless at this merry
season of the year, when folks up North were
having such happy times, wasn't it? But it
is wonderful how elastic the spirits of a soldier
are, and how jolly he can be under the
most adverse circumstances.</p>

<img class="mw" src="images/i216.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Eve around the Camp-Fire.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>"Well, Pointer, they hadn't any business
to put me out of the mess. That was a mean
trick, any way you take it."</p>

<p>"If we hadn't put you out of our mess,
you'd have eaten up our whole box from
home in one night. He's an awful glutton,
Pointer."</p>

<p>"Say, boys! I move we organize ourselves
into a court, and try this case," said Sergeant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Cummings. "They've been arguing and
arguing about this thing the whole day, and
it's time to take it up and put an end to it.
The case is&mdash;let's see; what'll we call it?
I'm not a very good hand at the legal lingo,
but I suppose if we call it a 'motion to quash
a writ of ejectment,' or something of that
sort, we'll be within the lines of the law.
Let me now state the case: Shell <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> Diehl
and Hottenstein. These three, all members
of Company D, after having lived, messed,
and sojourned together peaceably for a year
or more, have had of late some disagreement,
quarrel, squabble, fracas, or general tearing
out, the result of which said disagreement,
quarrel, squabble, et cetery, et cetery, has
been that the hereinbeforementioned Shell
has been thrown out of the mess and left to
the cold charities of the camp; and he, the
said Shell, now lodges a due and formal complaint
before this honorable court, presently
sitting on this pile of pine-brush, and humbly
prays and petitions reinstatement in his just
rights and claims, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non, e pluribus
unum, pro bono publico</i>!"</p>

<p>"Silence in the court!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
To organize ourselves into a court of justice
was a matter of a few moments. Cummings
was declared judge, Ruhl and Ransom his
assistants. A jury of twelve men, good and
true, was speedily impanelled. Attorneys and
tipstaves, sheriff and clerk were appointed,
and in less time than it takes to narrate it,
there we were, seated on piles of pine-brush
around a roaring camp-fire, with the snow
falling fast, and getting deeper every hour,
trying the celebrated case of "Shell <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i>
Diehl and Hottenstein." And a world of
merriment we had out of it, you may well
believe. When the jury, after having retired
for a few moments behind a pine-tree, brought
in a verdict for the plaintiff, it was full one
o'clock on Christmas morning, and we began
to drop off to sleep, some rolling themselves
up in their blankets and overcoats, and lying
down, Indian fashion, feet to the fire; while
others crept off to their cold shelters under
the snow-laden pine-trees for what poor rest
they could find, jocularly wishing one another
a "Merry Christmas!"</p>

<p>Time wore away monotonously in the camp
we established there, near Culpeper Court-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
All the more weary a winter was it
for me, because I was so sick that I could
scarcely drag myself about. So miserable
did I look, that one day a Company B boy said,
as I was passing his tent:</p>

<p>"Young mon, an' if ye don't be afther
pickin' up a bit, it's my opinion ye'll be
gathered home to your fathers purty soon."</p>

<p>I was sick with the same disease which slew
more men than fell in actual battle. We had
had a late fall campaign, and had suffered
much from exposure, of which one instance
may suffice:</p>

<p>We had been sent into Thoroughfare Gap
to hold that mountain pass. Breaking camp
there at daylight in a drenching rain, we
marched all day long, through mud up to our
knees, and soaked to the skin by the cold rain;
at night we forded a creek waist-deep, and
marched on with clothes frozen almost stiff;
at one o'clock the next morning we lay down
utterly exhausted, shivering helplessly, in
wet clothes, without fire, and exposed to the
north-west wind that swept the vast plain
keen and cold as a razor. Whoever visits the
Soldiers' Cemetery near Culpeper will there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
find a part of the sequel of that night-march;
the remainder is scattered far and wide over
the hills of Virginia, and in forgotten places
among the pines.</p>

<p>Could we have had home care and home
diet, many would have recovered. But what
is to be done for a sick man whose only
choice of diet must be made from pork, beans,
sugar, and hard-tack? Home? Ah yes, if we
only <em>could</em> get home for a month! Homesick?
Well, no, not exactly. Still we were not
entire strangers to the feelings of that poor
recruit who was one day found by his lieutenant
sitting on a fallen pine-tree in the
woods, crying as if his heart would break.</p>

<p>"Why," said the lieutenant, "what are
you crying for, you big baby, you?"</p>

<p>"I wish I was in my daddy's barn, boo,
hoo!"</p>

<p>"And what would you do if you were?"</p>

<p>The poor fellow replied, between his sobs:
"Why, if I was in my daddy's barn, <em>I'd go
into the house mighty quick</em>!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="medium">OUR FIRST DAY IN "THE WILDERNESS."</span></h2>

<p>At last the long winter, with its deep snows
and intense cold, was gone, and on May 4,
1864, at four o'clock in the morning, we
broke camp. In what direction we should
march, whether north, south, east, or west,
none of us had the remotest idea; for the
pickets reported the Rapidan River so well
fortified by the enemy on the farther bank,
that it was plainly impossible for us to break
their lines at any point there. But in those
days we had a general who had no such word
as "impossible" in his dictionary, and under
his leadership we marched that May morning
straight for and straight across the Rapidan,
in solid column. All day we plodded on, the
road strewn with blankets and overcoats, of
which the army lightened itself now that the
campaign was opening; and at night we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
halted, and camped in a beautiful green
meadow.</p>

<p>Not the slightest suspicion had we, as we
slept quietly there that night, of the great
battle, or rather series of great battles, about
to open on the following day. Even on that
morrow, when we took up the line of march
and moved leisurely along for an hour or two,
we saw so few indications of the coming
struggle, that, when we suddenly came upon
a battery of artillery in position for action by
the side of the road, some one exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, hello, fellows! that looks like business!"</p>

<p>Only a few moments later, a staff-officer
rode up to our regiment and delivered his
orders:</p>

<p>"Major, you will throw forward your command
as skirmishers for the brigade."</p>

<p>The regiment at once moved into the thick
pine-woods, and was lost to sight in a moment,
although we could hear the bugle
clanging out its orders, "deploy to right and
left," as the line forced its way through the
tangled and interminable "Wilderness."</p>

<p>Ordered back by the major into the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
line of battle, we drummer-boys found the
troops massed in columns along a road, and
we lay down with them among the bushes.
How many men were there we could not tell.
Wherever we looked, whether up or down the
road, and as far as the eye could reach, were
masses of men in blue. Among them was
a company of Indians, dark, swarthy, stolid-looking
fellows, dressed in our uniform, and
serving with some Iowa regiment, under the
command of one of their chiefs as captain.</p>

<p>But hark!</p>

<p>"Pop! Pop! Pop-pop-pop!" The pickets
are beginning to fire, the "ball is going to
open," and things will soon be getting lively.</p>

<p>A venturesome fellow climbs up a tall tree
to see what he can see, and presently comes
scrambling down, reporting nothing in sight
but signal-flags flying over the tree-tops, and
beyond them nothing but woods and woods
for miles.</p>

<p>Orderlies are galloping about, and staff-officers
are dashing up and down the line,
or forcing their way through the tangled
bushes, while out on the skirmish line is the
ever-increasing rattle of the musketry,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
"Pop-pop! Pop-pop-pop!"</p>

<p>"Fall in, men! Forward, guide right!"</p>

<p>There is something grand in the promptitude
with which the order is obeyed. Every
man is at his post. Forcing its way as best
it can through the tangled undergrowth of
briers and bushes, across ravines and through
swamps, our whole magnificent line advances,
until, after a half-hour's steady work, we
reach the skirmish line, which, hardly pressed,
falls back into the advancing column of
blue as it reaches a little clearing in the forest.
Now we see the lines of gray in the
edge of the woods on the other side of the
little field; first their pickets behind clumps
of bushes, then the solid column appearing
behind the fence, coming on yelling like demons,
and firing a volley that fills the air with
smoke and cuts it with whistling lead. Sheltered
behind the trees, our line reserves its
fire, for it is likely that the enemy will come
out on a charge, and then we'll mow them
down!</p>

<p>With bayonets fixed, and yells that make
the woods ring, here they come, boys, through
the clearing, on a dead run! And now, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
you love the flag that waves yonder in the
breeze, up, boys, and let them have it! Out
from our Enfields flashes a sheet of flame, before
which the lines of gray stagger for a moment;
but they recover and push on, then
reel again and quail, and at length fly before
the second leaden tempest, which sweeps the
field clear to the opposite side.</p>

<p>With cheers and shouts of "Victory!" our
line, now advancing swiftly from behind its
covert of the trees, sweeps into and across
the clearing, driving back the enemy into the
woods from which they had so confidently
ventured.</p>

<p>The little clearing over which the lines of
blue are advancing is covered with dead and
dying and wounded men, among whom I find
Lieutenant Stannard, of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Harry, help me, quick! I'm bleeding
fast. Tear off my suspender, or take my
handkerchief and tie it as tight as you can
draw it around my thigh, and help me off the
field."</p>

<p>Ripping up the leg of his trousers with
my knife, I soon check the flow of blood with
a hard knot,&mdash;and none too soon, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
main artery has been severed. Calling a
comrade to my assistance, we succeed in reaching
the woods, and make our way slowly to
the rear in search of the division-hospital.</p>

<p>Whoever wishes to know something of the
terrible realities of war should visit a field-hospital
during some great engagement. No
doubt my young readers imagine war to be a
great and glorious thing, and so, indeed, in
many regards it is. It would be idle to deny
that there is something stirring in the sound
of martial music, something strangely uplifting
and intensely fascinating in the roll of
musketry and the loud thunder of artillery.
Besides, the march and the battle afford opportunities
for the unfolding of manly virtue,
and as things go in this disjointed world,
human progress seems to be almost impossible
without war.</p>

<p>Yet still, war is a terrible, a horrible thing.
If my young readers could have been with us
as we helped poor Stannard off the field that
first day in "the Wilderness;" if they could
have seen the surgeons of the first division of
our corps as we saw them, when passing by
with the lieutenant on a stretcher,&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
would, I think, agree with me that if war is
a necessity, it is a dreadful necessity. There
were the surgeons, busy at work, while dozens
of poor fellows were lying all around on
stretchers awaiting their turns.</p>

<p>"Hurry on, boys, hurry on! Don't stop
here; I can't stand it!" groaned our charge.</p>

<p>So we pushed on with our burden, until
we saw our division-colors over in a clearing
among the pines, and on reaching this
we came upon a scene that I can never adequately
describe.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of the wounded already
there; other hundreds, perhaps thousands,
were yet to come. On all sides, within
and just without the hastily erected hospital-tents,
were the severely and dangerously
wounded, while great numbers of slightly
wounded men, with hands or feet bandaged
or heads tied up, were lying about the sides
of the tents or out among the bushes. The
surgeons were everywhere busy,&mdash;here dressing
wounds; there, alas! stooping down to
tell some poor fellow, over whose countenance
the pallor of death was already spreading, that
there was no longer any hope for him; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
down yonder, about a row of tables, each under
a fly,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> stood groups of them, ready for their
dreadful and yet helpful work.</p>

<div><a name="a_scene_in_the_field_hospital" id="a_scene_in_the_field_hospital"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i228.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">A Scene in the Field-Hospital.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>To one of these groups we carried poor
Stannard, and I stood by and watched. The
sponge saturated with chloroform was put to
his face, rendering him unconscious while the
operation of tying the severed artery was performed.
On a neighboring table was a man
whose leg was being taken off at the thigh,
and who, chloroformed into unconsciousness,
interested everybody by singing at the top of
his voice, and with a clear articulation, five
verses of a hymn to an old-fashioned Methodist
tune, never once losing the melody nor
stopping for a word. I remember seeing another
poor fellow with his arm off at the
shoulder, lying on the ground and resting
after the operation. He appeared to be very
much amused at himself, because (he said,
in answer to my inquiry as to what he was
laughing at) he had felt a fly on his right
hand, and when he went to brush it off with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
his left there was no right hand there any
more! I remember, too, seeing a tall prisoner
brought in and laid on the table,&mdash;a magnificent
specimen of physical development, erect,
well built, and strong looking, and with a
countenance full of frank and sturdy manliness.
As the wounded prisoner was stretched
out on the table, the surgeon said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Johnny, my man, what is the matter
with you, and what can we do for you
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor, your people have used me
rather rough to-day. In the first place, there's
something down in here," feeling about his
throat, "that troubles me a good deal."</p>

<p>Opening his shirt-collar, the surgeon found
a deep blue mark an inch or more below the
"Adam's apple." On pressing the blue lump
a little with the fingers, out popped a "minié"
ball, which had lodged just beneath the skin.</p>

<p>"Lucky for you that this was a 'spent
ball,' Johnny," said the surgeon, holding the
bullet between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Give me that, Doctor&mdash;give me that ball;
I want it," said Johnny, eagerly reaching out
his left hand for the ball. Then he carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
examined it, and put it away into his jacket-pocket.</p>

<p>"And now, Doctor, there's something else,
you see, the matter with me, and something
more serious too, I'm afraid. You see, I
can't use my right arm. The way was this:
we were having a big fight out there in the
woods. In the bayonet-charge I got hold of
one of your flags, and was waving it, when all
on a sudden I got an ugly clip in the arm
here, as you see."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Johnny. We shall treat you
just the same as our own boys, and though
you are dressed in gray, you shall be cared
for as faithfully as if you were dressed in
blue, until you are well and strong again."</p>

<p>Never did I see a more delighted or grateful
man than he, when, awakened from his deep
chloroform sleep, he was asked whether he did
not think his arm had better come off now?</p>

<p>"Just as you think best, Doctor."</p>

<p>"Look at your arm once, Johnny."</p>

<p>What was his glad surprise to find that the
operation had been already performed, and
that a neat bandage was wound about his
shoulder!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
The most striking illustration of the power
of religion to sustain a man in distress and
trial, I saw there in that field-hospital.</p>

<p>We had carried Stannard into a tent, and
laid him on a pile of pine-boughs, where, had
he only been able to keep quiet, he would
have done well enough. But he was not able
to keep quiet. A more restless man I never
saw. Although his wound was not considered
necessarily dangerous, yet he was evidently
in great fear of death, and for death, I grieve
to say, he was not at all prepared. He had
been a wild, wayward man, and now that he
thought the end was approaching, he was full
of alarm. As I bent over him, trying my
best, but in vain, to comfort and quiet him,
my attention was called to a man on the other
side of the tent, whose face I thought I knew,
in spite of its unearthly pallor.</p>

<p>"Why, Smith," said I, "is this you? Where
are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Come turn me around and see," he said.</p>

<p>Rolling him over carefully on his side, I
saw a great, cruel wound in his back.</p>

<p>My countenance must have expressed alarm
when I asked him, as quietly as I could,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
whether he knew that he was very seriously
wounded, and might die.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the look that man gave
me, as, with a strange light in his eye, he
said:</p>

<p>"I am in God's hands; I am not afraid to
die."</p>

<p>Two or three days after that, while we
were marching on rapidly in column again,
we passed an ambulance-train filled with
wounded on their way to Fredericksburg.
Hearing my name called by some one, I ran
out of line to an ambulance, in which I found
Stannard.</p>

<p>"Harry, for pity's sake, have you any
water?"</p>

<p>"No, lieutenant; I'm very sorry, but there's
not a drop in my canteen, and there's no time
now to get any."</p>

<p>It was the last time I ever saw him. He
was taken to Fredericksburg, submitted to a
second operation, and died; and I have always
believed that his death was largely owing
to want of faith.</p>

<p>Six months, or maybe a year, later, Smith
came back to us with a great white scar between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
his shoulders, and I doubt not he is
alive and well to this day.</p>

<p>And there was Jimmy Lucas too. They
brought him in about the middle of that same
afternoon, two men bearing him on their
arms. He was so pale, that I knew at a
glance he was severely hurt. "A ball through
the lungs," they said, and "he can't live."
Jimmy was of my own company, from my
own village. We had been school-fellows and
playmates from childhood almost, and you
may well believe it was sad work to kneel down
by his side and watch his slow and labored
breathing, looking at his pallid features, and
thinking&mdash;ah, yes, that was the saddest of
all!&mdash;of those at home. He would scarcely
let me go from him a moment, and when the
sun was setting, he requested every one to go
out of the tent, for he wanted to speak a few
words to me in private. As I bent down over
him, he gave me his message for his father
and mother, and a tender good by to his
sweetheart, begging me not to forget a single
word of it all if ever I should live to see them;
and then he said:</p>

<p>"And, Harry, tell father and mother I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
thank them now for all their care and kindness
in trying to bring me up well and in the
fear of God. I know I have been a wayward
boy sometimes, but my trust is in him who
said,'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' My
hope is in God, and I shall die a Christian
man."</p>

<p>When the sun had set that evening, poor
Jimmy had entered into rest. He was buried
somewhere among the woods that night, and
no flowers are strewn over his grave on
"Decoration Day" as the years go by, for no
head-board marks his resting-place among the
moaning pines; but "the Lord knoweth them
that are his."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="medium">A BIVOUAC FOR THE NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>If from any cause whatsoever one happened
to have lost his command, or to have
strayed away from or to have been left behind
by his regiment, he could usually tell with
tolerable certainty, as he trudged along the
road among the men of another command,
what part of the army he was with, and
whether any of his own corps or division were
anywhere near by; and he could tell this at
a glance, without so much as stopping to ask
a question. Do you ask how? I answer, by
the badges the men wore on their caps.</p>

<div><a name="army_badges" id="army_badges"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i236.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>ARMY BADGES.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An admirable and significant system of
badges was adopted for the entire Union
army. The different corps were distinguished
by the <em>shapes</em>, the different divisions by the
<em>colors</em>, of their several badges. Thus the First
Corps wore a round badge, the Second a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
clover-leaf, the Third a diamond, the Fifth a
Maltese cross, the Sixth a Roman cross, the
Ninth a shield, the Eleventh a crescent, the
Twentieth a star,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and so on. As each corps
usually included three divisions, and as it was
necessary to distinguish each of these from
the other two, the three good old colors of
the flag were chosen for this purpose,&mdash;red,
white, and blue,&mdash;red for the First Division
of each corps, white for the Second, and blue
for the Third. Thus a round red badge
meant First Division, First Corps; a round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
white, Second Division, First Corps; a round
blue, Third Division, First Corps; and so on
for the other corps. Division and corps headquarters
could always be known by their flags,
bearing the badges of their respective commands.
As the men were all obliged to wear
their proper badges, cut out of cloth or colored
leather, on the top of their caps, one could
always tell at a glance what part of the Army
of the Potomac he was with. In addition to
this, some regiments were distinguished by
some peculiarity of uniform. Our own brigade
was everywhere known as "The Buck-tails,"
for we all wore buck-tails on the side
of our caps.</p>

<p>It was in this way that I was able to tell
that none of my own brigade, division, or even
corps were anywhere near me, as, late one evening
about the middle of May, 1864, I wearily
trudged along the road, in the neighborhood
of Spottsylvania Court-house, in search of my
regiment. I had lost the regiment early in
the day, for I was so sick and weak when we
started in the morning, that it was scarcely
possible for me to drag one foot after the
other, much less to keep up at the lively pace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the men were marching. Thus it had happened
that I had been left behind. However,
after having trudged along all day as best I
could, when nightfall came on I threw myself
down under a pine-tree along the road which
led through the woods, stiff and sore in limb,
and half bewildered by a burning fever. All
around me the woods were full of men making
ready their bivouac for the night. Some were
cooking coffee and frying pork, some were
pitching their shelters, and some were already
stretched out sound asleep. But all, alas!
wore the red Roman cross. Could I only have
espied a Maltese cross somewhere, I should
have felt at home; for then I should have
known that the good old Fifth Corps was near
at hand. But no blue Maltese cross (the
badge of my own division) was anywhere to
be seen. As I lay there with half-closed eyes,
feverishly wondering where in the world I
was, and heartily wishing for the sight of
some one wearing a buck-tail on his cap, I
heard a well-known voice talking with some
one out in the road, and, leaning upon my
elbow, called out eagerly:</p>

<p>"Harter! Hello! Harter!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
"Hello! Who are you?" replied the sergeant,
peering in amongst the trees and bushes.
"Why, Harry, is that you? And where in the
world is the regiment?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I'd like to know," answered
I. "I couldn't keep up, and was left
behind, and have been lost all day. But where
have you been? I haven't seen you this
many a day."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, as he brought his gun
down to a rest and leaned his two hands on
the muzzle, "you see the Johnnies spoiled
my good looks a little back there in the Wilderness,
and I was sent to the hospital. But
I couldn't stand it there, wounded and dying
men all around one; and concluded to shoulder
my gun and start out and try to find the
boys. Look here," continued he, taking off a
bandage from the side of his face and displaying
an ugly-looking bullet-hole in his
right cheek. "See that hole? It goes clean
through, and I can blow through it. But it
don't hurt very much, and will no doubt heal
up before the next fight. Anyhow, I have
the chunk of lead that made that hole here
in my jacket pocket. See that!" said he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
taking out a flattened ball from his vest-pocket
and rolling it around in the palm of
his hand. "Lodged in my mouth, right between
my teeth. But I'm tired nearly to
death tramping around all day. Let's put
up for the night. Shall we strike up a tent,
or bunk down here under the pines?"</p>

<p>We concluded to put up a shelter, or rather,
I should say, Harter did so; for I was too
sick and weak to think of anything but sleep
and rest, and lay there at full length on a bed
of soft pine shatters, dreamily watching the
sergeant's preparations for the night. Throwing
off his knapsack, haversack, and accoutrements,
he took out his hatchet, trimmed
away the lower branches of two pine-saplings
which stood some six feet apart, cut a straight
pole, and laid it across from one to the other
of these saplings, buttoned together two shelters
and threw them across the ridge-pole,
staked them down at the corners, and throwing
in his traps, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There you are, 'as snug as a bug in a
rug.' And now for water, fire, and a supper."</p>

<p>A fire was soon and easily built, for dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
wood was plenty; and soon the flames were
crackling and lighting up the dusky woods.
Taking our two canteens, Harter started off
in search of water, leaving me to stretch myself
out in the tent and&mdash;heartily wish myself
at home.</p>

<p>For soldiering is all well enough so long as
one is strong and well. But when a man gets
sick he is very likely to find that all the romance
of marching by day and camping by
night is suddenly gone, and that there is, after
all, no place like home. For one, I was fully
conscious of this as I lay there in the tent
awaiting the sergeant's return. The sounds
which came to my ears from the woods all
around me,&mdash;of strong men's voices, some
shouting and some conversing in low tones;
the noise of axes and of falling trees; the
busy, bee-like hum, losing itself amongst the
trees and in the far distance; the bright glare
of the many fires, and the dancing lights and
shadows which seemed to people the forest
with ghostlike forms,&mdash;all this, although at
another time it would have had a singular
charm, now awakened no response in me.
One draught of water at the "Big Spring" at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
home, which I knew at that very moment
was gushing cool and clear as crystal out of
the hillside, and on the bottom of which I
could in vision see the white pebbles lying,
would have been worth to me all, and more
than all, the witchery of our bivouac for the
night. And I would have given more for a
bed on the hard floor on the landing at the
head of the stairs at home&mdash;I would not
have asked for a bed&mdash;than for a dozen
nights spent in the finest camps in the Army
of the Potomac. But the thought of the Big
Spring troubled me most. It seemed to me
I could see it with my eyes shut, and that I
could hear the water as it came gushing out
of the hillside and flowed down to the meadow,
plashing and rippling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you, Harry," said the sergeant,
suddenly interrupting my vision as he stepped
into the circle of light in front of our little
tent, and flung down his canteens, "there
isn't anything like military discipline. I
went down the road here about a quarter of
a mile and came out near General Grant's
headquarters, in a clearing. Down at the
foot of a hill right in front of his headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
is a spring: but it seems the surgeon of some
hospital near by had got there before the
general, and had placed a guard on the spring
to keep the water for the wounded. As I
came up, I heard the guard say to a darky
who had come to the spring for water with
a bucket,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Get out of that, you black rascal; you
can't have any water here.'</p>

<p>"'Guess I kin,' said the darky. 'I want
dis yere water for Gen'l Grant; an' ain't he a
commandin' dis yere army, or am you?'</p>

<p>"'You touch that water and I'll run my
bayonet through you,' said the guard. 'General
Grant can't have any water at this spring
till my orders are changed.'</p>

<p>"The darky, saying that he'd 'see 'bout
dat mighty quick,' went up the hill to headquarters,
and returned in a few moments declaring
that</p>

<p>"'Gen'l Grant said dat you got to gib me
water outen dis yere spring.'</p>

<div><a name="general_grant_cant_have_any_of_this_water" id="general_grant_cant_have_any_of_this_water"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i242.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>"<span class="smcap">General Grant can't have any of this Water!</span>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"'You go back and tell General Grant, for
me,' said the corporal of the guard, who came
up at the moment, 'that neither he nor any
other general in the Army of the Potomac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
can get water at this spring till my orders
are changed.'</p>

<p>"Now, you see," continued Harter, as he
gave me a tin cup on a stick to hold over the
fire for coffee, while he cut down a slice of
pork, "there's something mighty fine in the
idea of a man standing to his post though the
heavens fall, and obeying the orders given
him when he is put on guard, so that even
though the greatest generals in the army send
down contrary orders to him, he'll die before
he'll give in. A man is mighty strong when
he is on guard and obeys orders. Though
he's only a corporal, or even a private, he
can command the general commanding the
army. But I don't believe General Grant
sent that darky for water a second time."</p>

<p>Supper was soon ready, and soon disposed
of. Then, without further delay, while the
shadows deepened into thick night in the
forest, we rolled ourselves up in our blankets
and stretched ourselves out with our feet to
the fire. Dreamily watching the blazing light
of our little camp fire, and thinking each his
own thoughts of things which had been and
things which might be, we both soon fell
sound asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="medium">"WENT DOWN TO JERICHO AND FELL AMONG</span><br />
<span class="medium">THIEVES."</span></h2>

<p>On the morning of May 23d, 1864, after a
good and refreshing sleep, we took up the
line of march and moved rapidly all day in a
southerly direction, "straight for Richmond,"
according to our somewhat bewildered conception
of the geography of those parts.
With the exception of an occasional skirmish
and some heavy cannonading away along the
horizon, we had seen and heard but little of
the enemy for several days. Where he was
we did not know. We only hoped that, after
the terrible fighting of the last two weeks,
commencing at the Wilderness on the 5th, he
had had enough of it and had taken to his
heels and run away&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Away down South in Dixie's land,</div>
<div class="line i3">        Away, away,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and that we should never again see anything
of him but his back. Alas! for the presumption.
And alas! for the presumption of the
innumerable company and fellowship of cooks,
camp-followers, and mule-drivers, who, emboldened
by the quietude of the last few
days, had ventured to come up from the rear,
and had joined each his respective regiment,
and were marching along bravely enough, as
on the evening of this same May 23d we approached
North Anna River, which we were
to cross at a place called Jericho Ford. As
we came near to the river, we found the
supply and ammunition-trains "parked" to
the rear of a wood a short distance from
Jericho, so that as we halted for a while in
the edge of the woods nearest to the stream,
everything wore so quiet and unsuspicious a
look, that no one dreamed of the enemy being
anywhere near at hand. Under the impression
that we should probably halt there for
the night, I gathered up a number of the
boys' canteens and started out in search of
water, taking my course toward an open
meadow which lay to the right and close to
the river's edge. There was a cornfield off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
to the left, across which I could see the
troops leisurely marching in the direction of
the bridge. As I stooped down to fill my
canteens, another man came up on the same
errand as had brought me there. From
where I was, I could see the bridge full of
troops and the general rabble of camp followers
carelessly crossing. But scarcely had
I more than half filled my first canteen, when
the enemy, lying concealed in the woods on
the other side of the river, opened fire.</p>

<p>Boom! Bang! Whir-r-r! Chu-ck!</p>

<p>"Hello!" said I to my companion, "the
ball is going to open!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered he with a drawl and a
certain supercilious look, as if to intimate
that few besides himself had ever heard a
shell crack before&mdash;"Yes; but when you
have heard as many shells busting about
your head as I have"&mdash;</p>

<p>Whir-r-r! Chu-ck! I could hear the
terrific shriek of the shell overhead, and the
sharp <em>thud</em> of the pieces as they tore up the
meadow sod to the right and left of us; whereupon
my brave and boastful friend, leaving
his sentence to be completed and his canteens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
to be filled some other day, cut for the rear
at full speed, ducking his head as he went.
Finding an old gateway near by, with high
stone posts on either side, I took refuge
there; and feeling tolerably safe behind my
tall defence, turned about and looked toward
the river. It is said that there is but a step
from the sublime to the ridiculous; and surely
laughable indeed was the scene which greeted
my eyes. Everything was in confusion, and
all was helter-skelter, skurry, and skedaddle.
There was the bridge in open view, full of a
struggling mass of men, horses, and mules,&mdash;the
troops trying to force their way over to
the other side, and the yelling crowd of camp-followers
equally bent on forcing their way
back; some jumping or being tumbled off
the bridge, while others were swept, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens
volens</i>, over to the other side, and there began
to plunge into the dirty ooze of the stream,
with the evident intention of getting on the
safe side of things as speedily as possible,
while all the time the shells flew shrieking
and screaming through the air as though the
demons had been let loose. Between me and
the river was a last year's cornfield, over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
which the rabble now came swift and full,
fear furnishing wings to flight,&mdash;and happy
indeed was he who had no mule to take care
of! One poor fellow who had had his mule
heavily laden with camp equipage when he
crossed over, was now making for the rear
with his mule at a full trot, but in sad
plight himself; for he was hatless, covered
with mud, and quite out of breath, had lost
saddle, bag, and baggage, and had nothing left
but himself, the mule, and the halter. Another
immediately in front of me had come
on well enough until he arrived in the middle
of the open field, where the shells were falling
rather thick, when his mule took it into
his head that flight was disgraceful, and that
he would retreat no farther,&mdash;no, not an
inch. There he stood like a rock, the poor
driver pulling at his halter and frantically
kicking the beast in the ribs, but all to no
avail; while all around him, and past him,
swept the crowd of his fellow cooks and
coffee-coolers in full flight for the rear.</p>

<p>As soon as the firing began to cease a
little, I started off for the regiment, which
had meanwhile changed position. In searching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
for it, I passed the forage and ammunition-trains,
which were parked to the rear of the
woods, and within easy range of the enemy's
guns,&mdash;which latter fact the enemy, fortunately,
did not know. One who has not
actually seen them can scarcely form any
adequate idea of the vast numbers of white-covered
wagons which followed our armies,
carrying food, forage, and ammunition; nor
can any one who has not actually witnessed
a panic among the drivers of these wagons,
form any conception of the terror into which
they were sometimes thrown. The drivers of
the ammunition-wagons were especially anxious
to keep well out of range of shells,&mdash;and
no wonder! For if a shot from the enemy's
guns were to fall amongst a lot of wagons
laden with percussion shells, the result
may perhaps be imagined. It was no wonder,
therefore, that the driver of an ammunition-wagon,
with six mules in front of him and
several tons of death and destruction behind
him, felt somewhat nervous when he heard the
whirr of the shells over the tops of the pines.</p>

<p>In searching for the regiment I passed one
of these trains. A commissary sergeant was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
dealing out forage to his men, who were
standing around him in a circle, each holding
open a bag for his oats, which the commissary
was alternately dealing out to them
with a bucket,&mdash;a bucketful to this man,
then to the next, and so on around the circle.
It was plain, however, to any observer that
he was more concerned about the shells than
interested in the oats, for he dodged his
head every time a shell cracked, which happened
just about the time he was in the act
of pouring a bucketful of oats into a bag.</p>

<p>While I was looking at them, Page, a Michigan
boy who was well known to me, came
up on his horse in search of our division forage
train, for he was orderly to our brigadier-general,
and wanted oats for his horses. Stopping
a moment to contemplate the scene I was
admiring, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You just keep an eye on my horse a minute,
will you, and I'll show you how I get oats
for my horses when forage is scarce."</p>

<p>It was very often a difficult matter for the
mounted officers to get forage for their horses;
for our movements were so many and so sudden,
that it was plainly impossible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
trains to follow us wherever we went. Often
when we halted at night the wagons were
miles and miles away from us, and sometimes
we did not get a sight of them for a week,
or even longer. Then the poor hard-ridden
horses would have to suffer. But it was well
known that Page could get oats when nobody
else could. Though the wagon trains were
many miles in the rear, Page seldom permitted
his horses to go to bed supperless. Though an
American by birth, he was a Spartan in craft,
and had a wit as keen and sharp as a razor.
It was said that, rather than have his horses
go without their allowance, he would if necessary
sit up half the night, after a hard day's
march, and wait till everybody else was sound
asleep, and then quietly slip from under the
heads of the orderlies of other commands the
very oat-bags which, in order to guard them
the more securely, they were using for their
pillows; for oats Page would have for the
general's horse, by hook or by crook.</p>

<p>"You see the commissary yonder?" said
Page to me in a half-whisper, as he dismounted
and threw an empty bag over his
arm and gave his waist-belt a hitch: "he's a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
coward, he is. Look at him how he jukes his
head at every crack of the cannon! Don't
know whether he's dealing out oats to the
right man or not. Just you keep an eye on
my horse, will you?"</p>

<p>Now Page had no right in the least to draw
forage rations there, for that was not our
division-train. But as he did not know where
our division-train was, and as all the oats belonged
to Uncle Sam anyhow, why where was
the harm of getting your forage wherever you
could?</p>

<p>Pushing his way into the circle of teamsters,
who were too much engaged in watching
for shells to notice the presence of a
stranger, Page boldly opened his bag, while
Mr. Commissary, ducking his head between
his shoulders at every boom of the guns,
poured four bucketfuls of oats into the bag
of the new-comer, whereupon Page shouldered
his prize, mounted his horse, and rode
away with a smile on his face which said as
plainly as could be, "That's the way to do
it, my lad!"</p>

<p>In the wild <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> of that May evening there
at Jericho,&mdash;where evidently we had all fallen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
among thieves,&mdash;there was no little confusion
as to the rights of property; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</i> got sadly mixed; some horses had lost
their owners, and some owners had lost their
horses; and the same was the case with the
mules. So that by the time things began to
get quiet again, some of the boys had picked
up stray horses, or bought them for a mere
song. On coming up with the regiment, I
found that Andy had just concluded a bargain
of this sort. He had bought a sorrel horse.
The animal was a great raw-boned, ungainly
beast, built after the Gothic style of horse
architecture, and would have made an admirable
sign for a feed-store up North, as a substitute
for "Oats wanted; inquire within."
However, when I came up, Andy had already
concluded the bargain, and had become the
sole owner and proprietor of the sorrel horse
for the small consideration of ten dollars.</p>

<p>"Why, Andy!" exclaimed I, "what in the
name of all conscience do you want with a
horse? Going to join the cavalry?"</p>

<div><a name="andy_had_bought_the_sorrel_for_ten_dollars" id="andy_had_bought_the_sorrel_for_ten_dollars"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Andy had bought the Sorrel for Ten Dollars.</span>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Well," said Andy, with a grin, "I took
him on a speculation. Going to feed him up
a little"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
"Glad to hear it," said I; "he needs it
sadly."</p>

<p>"Yes; going to feed him up and then sell
him to somebody, and double my money on
him, you see. You may ride him on the
march and carry our traps. I guess the colonel
will give you permission. And, you
know, that would be a capital arrangement for
you, for you are so sick and weak that you are
often left behind on the march."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old boy," said I with a shrug.
"You always were a good, kind, thoughtful
soul; but if the choice must be between joining
the general cavalcade of coffee-coolers on
this old barebones of yours and marching
afoot, I believe I'd prefer the infantry."</p>

<p>However, we tied a rope around the neck of
<em>Bonaparte</em>, as we significantly called him,
fastened him up to a stake, rubbed him down,
begged some oats of Page, and pulled some
handfuls of young grass for him, and so left
him for the night.</p>

<p>I do not think Andy slept well that night.
How could he after so bold a dash into the
horse-market? Grotesque images of the
wooden horse of ancient Troy, and of Don
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Quixote on his celebrated Rosinante charging
the windmills, were no doubt hopelessly
mixed up in his dreams with wild vagaries
of General Grant at the head of Mosby's men
fiercely trying to force a passage across Jericho
Ford. For daylight had scarcely begun
to peep into the forest the next morning,
when Andy rolled out from under the blankets
and went to look after Bonaparte. I was
building a fire when he came back. It seemed
to me that he looked a little solemn.</p>

<p>"How's Bony this morning, Andy?" inquired
I.</p>

<p>Andy whistled a bit, stuck his hands into
his pockets, mounted a log, took off his cap,
made a bow, and said:</p>

<p>"Comrades and fellow-citizens, lend me
your ears, and be silent that you may hear!
This is my first and last speculation in horseflesh.
<em>Bony is gone!</em>"</p>

<p>It was indeed true. We had fallen among
thieves, and they had even baffled Andy's plan
for future money-making; for none of us ever
laid eyes on Bony again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="medium">IN THE FRONT AT PETERSBURG.</span></h2>

<p>"Andy, let's go a-swimming."</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, I don't know about that. I'd
like to take a good plunge; but, you see,
there's no telling how soon we may move."</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of Tuesday, June 14,
1864. We had been marching and fighting
almost continually for five weeks and more,
from the Wilderness to Spottsylvania, over
the North Anna, in at Cold Harbor, across
the Pamunky and over the Chickahominy
to the banks of the James River, about a
mile and a half from which we were now
lying, along a dusty road. We were sunburned,
covered with dust, and generally used
up, so that a swim in the river would be a
refreshment indeed.</p>

<p>Having learned from one of the officers
that the intention evidently was to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
where we then were until the entire corps
should come up, and that we should probably
cross the river at or somewhere near that
point, we resolved to risk it.</p>

<p>So, over a cornfield we started at a good
pace. We had not gone far, when we discovered
a mule tied up in a clump of bushes,
with a rope around his neck. And this long-eared
animal, as Gothic as Bonaparte in his
style of architecture, we decided, after a solemn
council of war, to declare contraband,
and forthwith we impressed him into service,
intending to return him, after our bath, on
our way back to camp. Untying Bucephalus
from the bush, we mounted, Andy in front
and I on behind, each armed with a switch,
and we rode along gayly enough, with our
feet dangling among the corn-stalks.</p>

<p>For a while all went well. We fell to
talking about the direction we had come
since leaving the Pamunky; and Andy, who
was usually such an authority on matters
geographical and astronomical that on the
march he was known in the company as "the
compass," confessed to me as we rode on
that he himself had been somewhat turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
about in that march over the Chickahominy
swamp.</p>

<p>"And as for me," said I, "I think this is
the awfullest country to get turned about in
that I ever did see. Why, Andy, while we
were lying over there in the road it seemed to
me that the sun was going down in the east.
Fact! But when I took my canteen and
went over a little ridge to the rear to look
for water for coffee, I found, on looking up,
that on that side of the ridge the sun was all
right. Yet when I got back to the road and
looked around, judge of my surprise when I
found the whole thing had somehow swung
around again, and the sun was going down
in the east! And you may judge still further
of my surprise, Andy, when, on going and
walking back and forth across that ridge, I
found one particular spot from which, if I
looked in one direction, the sun was going
down all right in the west; but if in the
opposite direction, he was going down all
wrong, entirely wrong, in the east!"</p>

<p>"Whoa dar! Whoa dar! Whar you gwine
wid dat dar mule o' mine? Whoa, Pete!"</p>

<p>The mule stopped stock-still as we caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
sight of the black head and face of a darky
boy peering forth from the door of a tobacco-house
that we were passing. Possibly, he was
the owner of the whole plantation now, and
the mule Pete might be his only live-stock.</p>

<p>"Where are we going, Pompey? Why
we're going 'on to Richmond!'"</p>

<p>"On ter Richmon'! An' wid dat dar mule
o' mine! 'Clar to goodness, sodgers, can't
git along widout dat mule. Better git off'n
dat dar mule!"</p>

<p>"Whip him up, Andy!" shouted I.</p>

<p>"Come up, Bucephalus!" shouted Andy.</p>

<p>And we both laid on right lustily. But
never an inch would that miserable mule
budge from the position he had taken on
hearing the darky's voice, until all of a sudden,
and as if a mine had been sprung under
our feet, there was such a striking out of
heels and such an uncomfortable elevation in
the rear, the angle of which was only increased
by increased cudgelling, that at last,
with an enormous spring, Andy and I were
sent flying off into the corn.</p>

<div><a name="better_git_offn_dat_dar_mule" id="better_git_offn_dat_dar_mule"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Better git off'n dat dar Mule!</span>"</p>

<p>"Yi! yi! yi! Didn' I say better git off'n
dat dar mule o' mine? Yi! yi! yi!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Laughing as heartily as the darky at our
misadventure, we felt that it would be safer
to make for the river afoot. We had a glorious
plunge in the waters of the James, and
returned to the regiment at sunset, greatly
refreshed.</p>

<p>The next day we crossed the James in
steamboats. There were thousands of men
in blue all along both shores; some were
crossing, some were already over, and others
were awaiting their turn. By the middle of
the forenoon we were all well over, and it has
been said that, had we pushed on without
delay, the story of the siege of Petersburg
would have read quite differently. But we
waited,&mdash;for provisions, I believe,&mdash;and during
this halt the whole corps took a grand
swim in the river. We marched off at three
o'clock in the afternoon, over a dusty road
and without fresh water, and reached the
neighborhood of Petersburg at midnight, but
did not get into position until after several
days of hard fighting in the woods.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give a clear and
interesting account of the numerous engagements
in which we took part around that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
long-beleaguered city, where for ten months
the two great armies of the North and South
sat down to watch and fight each other until
the end came. For, after days and days of
man&oelig;uvring and fighting, attack and sally,
it became evident that Petersburg could not
be carried by storm, and there was nothing
for it but to sit down stubbornly, and, by
cutting off all railroad supplies and communications,
starve it into surrender.</p>

<p>It may be interesting, however, to tell
something of the everyday life and experience
of our soldiers during that great
siege.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Finding a Wounded Picket in a Rifle-Pit.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Digging becomes almost an instinct with
the experienced soldier. It is surprising
how rapidly men in the field throw up fortifications,
how the work progresses, and
what immense results can be accomplished
by a body of troops in a single night. Let
two armies fight in the open field one evening&mdash;by
the next morning both are strongly
intrenched behind rifle-pits and breastworks,
which it will cost either side much blood to
storm and take. If spades and picks are at
hand when there is need of fortifications,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
well; if not, bayonets, tin cups, plates, even
jack-knives, are pressed into service until
better tools arrive; and every man works
like a beaver.</p>

<p>Thus it was that although throughout the
18th of June the fighting had been severe,
yet, in spite of weariness and darkness, we
set to work, and the morning found us behind
breastworks; these we soon so enlarged and
improved that they became well-nigh impregnable.
At that part of the line where our
regiment was stationed, we built solid works
of great pine-logs, rolled up, log on log, seven
feet high and banked with earth on the side
toward the enemy, the whole being ten feet
through at the base. On the inside of these
breastworks we could walk about perfectly
safe from the enemy's bullets, which usually
went singing harmlessly over our heads.</p>

<p>On the outside of these works were further
defences. First, there was the ditch made by
throwing up the ground against the logs;
then, farther out, about twenty or thirty
yards away, was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i>&mdash;a peculiar
means of defence made by cutting off the
tops and heavy limbs of trees, sharpening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the ends, and planting them firmly in the
ground in a long row, the sharpened ends
pointing toward the enemy, the whole being
so close and so compacted together with telegraph-wires
everywhere twisted in, that it was
impossible for a line of battle to get through
it without being cut off to a man. Here and
there, at intervals, were left gaps wide enough
to admit a single man, and it was through
these man-holes that the pickets passed out
to their pits beyond.</p>

<p>Fifty yards in front of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i> the pickets
were stationed. When first the siege began,
picketing was dangerous business. Both
armies were bent on fight, and picketing
meant simply sharpshooting. As a consequence,
at first the pickets were posted only
at night, so that from midnight to midnight
the poor fellows lay in their rifle-pits under a
broiling July sun, with no protection from
the intolerable heat, excepting the scanty
shade of a little pine-brush erected overhead,
or in front of the pit as a screen. There the
picket lay, flat on his face, picking off the
enemy's men whenever he could catch sight
of a head, or even so much as a hand; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
right glad would he be if, when the long-awaited
relief came at length, he had no
wounds to show.</p>

<p>But later on, as the siege progressed, this
murderous state of affairs gradually disappeared.
Neither side found it pleasant or
profitable, and nothing was gained by it. It
decided nothing, and only wasted powder and
ball. And so, gradually the pickets on both
sides began to be on quite friendly terms. It
was no unusual thing to see a Johnny picket&mdash;who
would be posted scarcely a hundred
yards away, so near were the lines&mdash;lay
down his gun, wave a piece of white paper as
a signal of truce, walk out into the neutral
ground between the picket-lines, and meet
one of our own pickets, who, also dropping
his gun, would go out to inquire what Johnny
might want to-day.</p>

<p>"Well, Yank, I want some coffee, and I'll
trade tobacco for it."</p>

<p>"Has any of you fellows back there some
coffee to trade for tobacco? 'Johnny Picket,'
here, wants some coffee."</p>

<p>Or maybe he wanted to trade papers, a
Richmond <i>Enquirer</i> for a New York <i>Herald</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
or <i>Tribune</i>, "even up and no odds." Or he
only wanted to talk about the news of the
day&mdash;how "we 'uns whipped you 'uns up the
valley the other day;" or how "if we had
Stonewall Jackson yet, we'd be in Washington
before winter;" or maybe he only
wished to have a friendly game of cards!</p>

<p>There was a certain chivalrous etiquette developed
through this social intercourse of
deadly foemen, and it was really admirable.
Seldom was there breach of confidence on
either side. It would have gone hard with
the comrade who should have ventured to
shoot down a man in gray who had left his
gun and come out of his pit under the sacred
protection of a piece of white paper. If disagreement
ever occurred in bartering, or high
words arose in discussion, shots were never
fired until due notice had been given. And I
find mentioned in one of my old army letters
that a general fire along our entire front grew
out of some disagreement on the picket-line
about trading coffee for tobacco. The two
pickets couldn't agree, jumped into their pits,
and began firing, the one calling out: "Look
out, Yank, here comes your tobacco." Bang!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
And the other replying: "All right,
Johnny, here comes your coffee." Bang!</p>

</div></div>

<p>Great forts stood at intervals all along the
line as far as the eye could see, and at these
the men toiled day and night all summer
long, adding defence to defence, and making
"assurance doubly sure," until the forts stood
out to the eye of the beholder, with their
sharp angles and well-defined outlines, formidable
structures indeed. Without attempting
to describe them in technical military
language, I will simply ask you to imagine a
piece of level ground, say two hundred feet
square, surrounded by a bank of earth about
twenty feet in height, with rows of gabions<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and sand-bags arranged on top of the embankment,
and at intervals along the sides
embrasures or port-holes, at which the great
cannon were planted,&mdash;and you will have
some rough notion of what one of our forts
looked like. Somewhere within the inclosure,
usually near the centre of it, was the magazine,
where the powder and shells were stored.
This was made by digging a deep place
something like a cellar, covering it over with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
heavy logs, and piling up earth and sand-bags
on the logs, the whole, when finished, having
the shape of a small round-topped pyramid.
At the rear was left a small passage, like a
cellar-way, and through this the ammunition
was brought up. If ever the enemy could
succeed in dropping a shell down that little
cellar-door, or in otherwise piercing the magazine,
then good by to the fort and all and
everybody in and around it!</p>

<p>On the outside of each large fort there were,
of course, all the usual defences of ditch, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i>,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>, to render approach
very dangerous to the enemy.</p>

<p>The enemy had fortifications like ours,&mdash;long
lines of breastworks, with great forts at
commanding positions; and the two lines
were so near that, standing in one of our
forts, I could have carried on a conversation
with a man in the fort opposite. I remember,
while on the picket-line one evening, watching
a body of troops moving along the edge
of a wood within the enemy's works, and
quite easily distinguishing the color of their
uniforms.</p>

<p>I have said already that, inside of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
breastworks, one was quite secure against the
enemy's bullets. But bullets were not the
only things we had to look out for,&mdash;there
were the shell, the case-shot, and I know not
what shot besides. Every few hours these
would be dropped behind our breastworks,
and often much execution was done by them.
To guard against these missiles, each mess
built what was called a "bomb-proof," which
consisted of an excavation about six feet
square by six deep, covered with heavy logs,
the logs covered with earth, a little back cellar-way
being left on the side away from the
enemy. Into this bomb-proof we could dart
the moment the shelling began, and be as safe
as in our own mother's kitchen. Our shelter-tents
we pitched on top of the bomb-proof, and
in this upper story we lived most of the time,
dropping down occasionally into the cellar.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p>"Fall into your pits, boys!" and in a trice
there wasn't so much as a blue coat in sight.</p>

<p>Familiarity breeds contempt,&mdash;even of danger;
and sometimes we were caught. Thus,
one day, when there had been no shelling for
a long time, and we had grown somewhat careless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and were scattered about under the trees,
some sleeping and others sitting on top of the
breastworks to get a mouthful of fresh air, all
of a sudden the guns of one of the great forts
opposite us opened with a rapid fire, dropping
shells right among us. Of course there was
a "scatteration" as we tried to fall into our
pits pell-mell; but, for all our haste, several
of us were severely hurt. There was a boy
from Philadelphia,&mdash;I forget his name,&mdash;sitting
on the breastworks writing a letter home;
a piece of shell tore off his arm with the pen
in his hand. A lieutenant received an iron
slug in his back, while a number of other men
were hurt. And such experiences were of
frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>A great victory had been gained by our
cavalry somewhere (I think by Sheridan), and
one evening an orderly rode along the line to
each regimental headquarters, distributing
despatches containing an account of the victory,
with instructions that the papers be read
to the men. Cheers were given all along the
line that night, and a shotted salute was ordered
at daylight the next morning.</p>

<p>At sunrise every available gun from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Appomattox to the Weldon Railroad must
have been brought into service and trained
against the enemy's works, for the noise was
terrific. And still further to increase the din,
the Johnnies, supposing it to be a grand assault
along the whole line, replied with every
gun they could bring to bear, and the noise
was so great that you would have thought the
very thunders of doom were rolling. After
the firing had ceased, the Johnnies were informed
that "we have only been giving three
iron cheers for the victory Sheridan has
gained up the valley lately." There was, I
presume, some regret on the other side over
the loss of powder and shot. At all events,
whenever, after that, similar iron cheers were
given, and this was not seldom the case, the
enemy preserved a moody silence.</p>

<p>After remaining in our works for about a
month, we were relieved by other troops and
marched off to the left in the direction of the
Weldon Railroad, which we took after severe
fighting. We held it, and at once fortified
our position with a new line of works, thus
cutting off one of the main lines of communication
between Petersburg and the South.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="medium">FUN AND FROLIC.</span></h2>

<p>In what way to account for it I know not,
but so it is, that soldiers always have been,
and I suppose always will be, merry-hearted
fellows and full of good spirits. One would
naturally suppose that, having so much to do
with hardship and danger every day, they
would be sober and serious above the generality
of men. But such was by no means the
case with our Boys in Blue. In camp, on
the march, nay even in the solemn hour of
battle, there was ever and anon a laugh passing
down the line or some sport going on
amongst the tents. Seldom was there wanting
some one noted for his powers of storytelling,
to beguile the weary hours about the
camp-fire at the lower end of the company
street, or out among the pines on picket.
Few companies could be found without some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
native-born wag or wit, whose comical songs
or quaint remarks kept the boys in good
humor, while at the same time each and all,
according to the measure of their several
capacities, were given to playing practical
jokes of one kind or other for the general
enlivenment of the camp.</p>

<p>There was Corporal Harter, for example,
of my own company. I do not single him
out as a remarkable wit, or in any sense as a
shining light in our little galaxy of Boys in
Blue; but choose him rather as an average
specimen. More than one was the trick
which Harter played on Andy and myself&mdash;though
I cannot help but remember, also, that
he sometimes had good ground for so doing,
as the following will show.</p>

<p>It was while we were yet lying around
Washington during the winter of 1863, that
Harter and I one day secured a "pass" and
went into the city. In passing the Treasury
Department we found a twenty-five cent note.
We had at first a mind to call on the Secretary
of the Treasury and ask whether he had
lost it, as we had found it in front of his establishment;
but thinking that it would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
go very far toward paying the expenses of the
war, and reflecting that even if it did belong
to Uncle Sam, we belonged to Uncle Sam
too, and so where could be the harm of our
keeping it and laying it out on ourselves?&mdash;we
finally concluded to spend it at a certain
print-shop on Pennsylvania Avenue, where
were exposed for sale great numbers of colored
pictures of different generals and statesmen,
a prize of cheap gilt jewelry being given with
each picture. For the jewelry we cared not a
whit; but the pictures each of us was anxious
to possess, for they would make very nice
decorations for our tents, we thought. Having,
then, purchased a number of these with
our treasure-trove, and having received from
the shopkeeper a handful of brass earrings,
which neither of us wanted (for what in the
world did a soldier want with brass earrings,
or even with gold ones, for the matter of
that?), we took our way to the park, west of
the Capitol buildings, and sat down on a
bench.</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," said the corporal, as he sat
wistfully looking at a picture of a general
dressed in the bluest of blue uniforms, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
with sword drawn and horse at full gallop,
dismounted cannon in the rear and clouds of
blue smoke in front, was apparently leading
his men on to the desperate charge. The
men had not come on the field yet, but it was
of course understood by the general's looks
that they were coming somewhere in the
background. A person can't have <em>everything</em>
in a picture, at the rate of four for a quarter,
with a handful of earrings thrown in to
clinch the bargain,&mdash;all of which, no doubt,
passed rapidly through the corporal's mind
as he examined the pictures,&mdash;"Now, Harry,
how will we divide 'em?"</p>

<p>"Well, corporal," answered I, "suppose we
do it this way: we'll toss up a penny for it.
'Heads I win, tails you lose,' you know. If
it comes head I'll take the pictures and you'll
take the jewelry; if it comes tail you'll take
the jewelry and I'll take the pictures. That's
fair and square, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The corporal's head could not have been
very clear that morning, or he would have
seen through this nicely laid little scheme as
clearly as one can see through a grindstone
with a hole in the middle. But the proposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
was so rapidly announced, and set forth
with such an appearance of candor and exact
justice, that, not seeing the trap laid for him,
he promptly got out a penny from his pocket,
and balancing it on his thumb-nail, while he
thoughtfully squinted up toward a tree-top
near by, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess that's fair. Here goes&mdash;but,
hold on. How is it, now? Say it over again."</p>

<p>"Why, it's as plain as the nose on your
face, man. Don't you see? If it comes head,
then I take the pictures and you take the
jewelry. If it comes tail, then you take the
jewelry and I take the pictures. Nothing
could be plainer than that; so, flop her up,
corporal."</p>

<p>"All right, Harry. Here she go&mdash;. But
hold on!" said he, as a new light seemed to
dawn on his mind, while he raised his cap
and thoughtfully scratched his head. "Let
me see. Ah! you young rascal! You're
sharp, you are! Going to gobble up the
whole grist of illuminated generals and statesmen,
and leave me this handful of brass earrings
and breastpins to send home to the girl
I left behind me&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
But every dog has his day, and whether or
not Harter bided his time for retaliation, or
had quite forgotten about 'heads I win, tails
you lose,' by the time we got down into Virginia,
yet so it was that in more than one
camp he gave Andy and myself a world of
trouble. More than one evening in winter-quarters,
as we sat about our fire, cartridges
were dropped down our chimney by some unseen
hand, driving us out of our tent in a
jiffy; and it was not seldom that our pan of
frying hard-tack was sent a flying by a sudden
explosion. It was wasted breath to ask who
did it.</p>

<p>We were lying in camp near the Rappahannock
some time along in the fall of 1863,
when Andy said one day,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, Harry, let's have some <em>roast</em>
beef once. I'm tired of this everlasting frying
and frizzling, and my mouth just waters
for a good roast. And I've just learned how
to do it, too, for I saw a fellow over here in
another camp at it, and I tell you it's just
fine. You see, you take your chunk of beef
and wrap it up in a cloth or newspaper, and
then you get some clay and cover it thick all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
over with the clay, until it looks like a big
forty-pound cannon-ball, and then you put it
in among the red-hot coals, and it bakes hard
like a brick; and when it's done, you just
crack the shell off, and out comes your roast
fit for the table of a king."</p>

<p>We at once set to work, and all went well
enough till Harter came along that way.
While Andy was off for more clay, and I was
looking after more paper, Harter fumbled
around our beef, saying he didn't believe we
could roast it that way.</p>

<p>"Just you wait, now," said Andy, coming
in with the clay; "we'll show you."</p>

<p>So we covered our beef thick with stiff clay,
and rolled the great ball into the camp-fire,
burying it among the hot ashes and coals, and
sat down to watch it, while the rest of the
boys were boiling their coffee and frying their
steaks for dinner. The fire was a good one,
and there were about a dozen black tin cups
dangling on as many long sticks, their several
owners squatting about in a circle,&mdash;when
all of a sudden, with a terrific bang, amid a
shower of sparks and hot ashes, the coffee-boilers
were scattered, right and left, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
dozen quarts of coffee sent hissing and sizzling
into the fire. Our poor roast beef was a sorry
looking mess indeed when we picked it out of
the general wreck.</p>

<p>We always believed that Harter had somehow
smuggled a cartridge into that beef of
ours while our backs were turned, and we
determined to pay him back in his own coin
on the very first favorable opportunity. It
was a long time, however, before the coveted
opportunity came; in fact it was quite a
year afterward, and happened in this wise.</p>

<p>We were lying in front of Petersburg,
some little while after the celebrated Petersburg
mine explosion, of which my readers
have no doubt often heard. We were playing
a game of chess one day, Andy and I,
behind the high breastworks. Our chessmen
we had whittled out of soft white pine with
our jack-knives. I remember we were at
first puzzled to know how to distinguish our
men; for, all being whittled out of white
pine, both sides were of course alike white,
and it was impossible to keep them from getting
sadly confused during the progress of
the game. At length, however, we hit on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the expedient of staining one half of our
men with tincture of iodine, which we begged
of the surgeon, and then they did quite well.
Our kings we called generals,&mdash;one Grant,
the other Lee,&mdash;the knights were cavalry, the
castles forts, the bishops chaplains, and the
pawns Yanks and Johnny Rebs. We were
deep in a game of chess with these our men
one day, when Andy suddenly broke a long
silence by saying:</p>

<p>"Harry, do you remember how Harter
blew up our beef-roast last year down there
along the Rappahannock? And don't you
think it's pretty nearly time we should pay
him back? Because if you do, I've got a
plan for doing it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Andy, I remember it quite well;
but then, you know, we are not quite sure
he did it. Besides, he was corporal then, and
he's captain now, and he might play the
mischief with us if he catches us at any nice
little game of that sort."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" exclaimed Andy, as he
threw out his cavalry on my right flank.
"He won't find out; and if he does, 'all's fair
in love, war, and controversy,' you know, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
I'm sure we can rely on his good nature,
even if he does get a little riled."</p>

<p>On examining into matters at the conclusion
of the game, we found that the captain
was on duty somewhere, and that, so far, the
coast was clear. Entering his tent, we found
a narrow bunk of poles on either side, with
an open space of several feet between the
two. Here, while Andy set out in search of
ammunition, I was set to digging a six-inch
square hole in the ground, into which we
emptied the powder of a dozen cartridges,
covering all carefully with earth, and laying
a long train, or running fuse, out of the rear
of the tent.</p>

<p>When Harter came in for dinner, and was
comfortably seated on his bunk with his cup
of bean-soup on his knee, suddenly there was
a fiz-z-z and a boom! and Harter came dashing
out of his tent, covered with gravel and
bespattered with bean soup, to the great merriment
of the men, who instantly set up
shouts of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fall in your pits!"</p>

<p>"Petersburg mine explosion!"</p>

<p>"'Nother great Union victory!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Did he get cross? Well, it was natural he
should feel a little vexed when the fur was so
rudely brushed the wrong way; but he tried
not to show it, and laughed along with the
rest; for in war, as in peace, a man must learn
to join in a laugh at his own expense sometimes,
as well as to make merry over the
mishaps of others.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>A famous and favorite kind of sport, especially
when we had been long lying in camp
in summer, or were in quarters in winter, was
what was commonly known as "raiding the
sutler."</p>

<p>We heard a great deal in those days about
"raids." We read in the newspapers which
occasionally fell into our hands, or heard on
the picket-line, of raids into Maryland and
raids into Pennsylvania, sometimes by Mosby's
men, and sometimes by Stuart's cavalry;
and it was quite natural, when growing weary
of the dull monotony of camp life, to look
around for some one to raid. Very often the
sutler was the chosen victim. He was
selected, not because he was a civilian and
wore citizen's clothes, but chiefly because of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
what seemed to the boys the questionable
character of his pursuit,&mdash;making money
out of the soldiers. "Here we are,"&mdash;for so
the men would reason&mdash;"here we are,&mdash;left
home and took our lives in our hands&mdash;in
for 'three years or sooner shot'&mdash;get thirteen
dollars a month and live on hard-tack; and
over there is that sutler, at whose shop a
man may spend a whole month's pay and
hardly get enough to make a single good
meal&mdash;it's a confounded mean business!"</p>

<p>The sutler seldom enjoyed much respect,
as how could he when he flourished and fattened
on our hungry stomachs? Of course, if
a man spent the whole of his month's pay for
ginger-cakes and sardines, why it was his own
fault. He did not need to spend his money if
he did not choose to do so. But it was hardly
in human nature to live on pork, bean-soup,
and hard-tack day after day, and not feel the
mouth water at the sight of the sutler's counter,
with its array of delicacies, poor and common
though they were. Besides, the sutler
usually charged most exorbitant prices&mdash;two
ginger-cakes for five cents, four apples
for a quarter, eighty cents for a small can of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
condensed milk, and ninety for a pound of
butter, which Andy usually denounced in
vigorous Biblical terms as being as strong as
Samson and as old as Methuselah. Maybe
the sutler's charges were none too high, when
his many risks were duly considered; for he
was usually obliged to transport his goods a
great distance, over almost impassable roads,
and was often liable to capture by the enemy's
foraging parties, besides being exposed
to numerous other fortunes of war, whereby
he might lose his all in an hour. But soldiers
in search of sport were not much disposed to
take a just and fair view of all his circumstances.
What they saw was only this&mdash;that
they wanted somebody to raid, and who
could be a fitter subject than the sutler?</p>

<p>The sutler's establishment was a large wall
tent, usually pitched on the side of the camp
farthest away from the colonel's quarters. It
was therefore in a somewhat exposed and
tempting position. Whenever it was thought
well to raid him, the men of his own regiment
would usually enter into a contract
with those of some neighboring regiment&mdash;</p>

<p>"You fellows come over here some night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and raid our sutler, and then we'll come
over to your camp some night and raid your
sutler. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>It was generally agreed to, this courteous
offer of friendly offices; and great, though indescribable,
was the sport which often resulted.
For when all had been duly arranged and
made ready, some dark night when the sutler
was sleeping soundly in his tent, a skirmish
line from the neighboring regiment would
cautiously pick its way down the hill and
through the brush, and silently surround the
tent. One party, creeping close in by the
wall of the tent, would loosen the ropes and
remove them from the stakes on the one side,
while another party on the other side, at a
given signal, would pull the whole concern
down over the sutler's head. And then would
arise yells and cheers for a few moments, followed
by immediate silence as the raiding
party would steal quietly away.</p>

<p>Did they steal his goods? Very seldom;
for soldiers are not thieves, and plunder was
not the object, but only fun. Why did not
the officers punish the men for doing this?
Well, sometimes they did. But sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the officers believed the sutler to be exorbitant
in his charges and oppressive to the men, and
cared little how soon he was cleared out and
sent a-packing; and therefore they enjoyed the
sport quite as well as the men, and often did
as Nelson did when he put his blind eye to
the telescope and declared he did not see the
signal to recall the fleet. They winked at the
frolic and came on the scene usually in ample
time to condole with the sutler, but quite too
late to do him any service.</p>

<p>Thus, once when the sutler was being raided
he hastily sent for the "officer of the day,"
whose business it was to keep order in the
camp. But he was so long in coming, that
the boys were in the height of their sport
when he arrived; and not wishing to spoil
their fun, he gave his orders in two quite different
ways,&mdash;one in a very loud voice, intended
for the sutler to hear, and the other
in a whisper, designed for the boys:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>Loud.</em>) "Get out of this! Put you all in
the guard-house!"</p>

<p>(<em>Whisper.</em>) "Pitch in, boys! Pitch in,
boys!"</p>

<p>The sutler's tent was often a favorite lounging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
place with the officers. One evening early
a party of about a dozen officers were seated
on boxes and barrels in the sutler's establishment.
All of them wanted cigars, but no one
liked to call for them, for cigars were so dear
that no one cared about footing the bill for
the whole party, and yet could not be so impolite
as to call for one for himself alone. As
they sat there with the flaps of the tent thrown
back, they could see quite across the camp to
the colonel's quarters beyond.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Captain K&mdash;&mdash;, "I see
the chaplain coming down Company C street,
and I think he is coming here; and if he does
come here we'll have some fun at his expense.
We all want cigars, and we might as well confess
what is an open secret, that none of us
dares to call for a cigar for himself alone, nor
feels like footing the bill for the whole party.
Well, let the sutler set out a few boxes of
cigars on the counter, so as to have them
handy when they are needed, and you follow
my lead, and we'll see whether we can't somehow
or other make the chaplain yonder pay
the reckoning."</p>

<p>The chaplain in question, be it remembered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
made some pretension to literature, and considered
himself quite an authority in camp on
all questions pertaining to orthography, etymology,
syntax, and prosody; and presumed
to be an umpire in all matters which might
from time to time come into discussion in the
realm of letters. So, when he came into the
sutler's tent, Captain K&mdash;&mdash; saluted him
with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good evening, Chaplain; you're just the
very man we want to see. We've been having
a little discussion here, and as we saw you
coming we thought we'd submit the question
to you for decision."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the chaplain, with
a smile of gratification, "I shall be only too
happy to render you what poor assistance I
can. May I inquire what may be the question
under discussion?"</p>

<p>"It is but a small thing," replied the captain;
"you might, I suppose, call it more a
<em>matter of taste</em> than anything else. It concerns
a question of emphasis, or rather, perhaps,
of inflection, and it is this: Would you
say, 'Gentlemen, will you have a cigár?' or
'Gentlemen, will you have a cigàr?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Pushing his hat forward as he thoughtfully
scratched his head, the chaplain, after a pause,
responded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, there don't seem to be much difference
between the two. But, on consideration,
I believe I would say, 'Gentlemen, will you
have a cigár?'"</p>

<p>"<em>Certainly!</em>" exclaimed they all, in full
and hearty chorus, as they rushed up to the
counter in a body and each took a handful of
cigars with a "Thank you, Chaplain," leaving
their bewildered literary umpire to pay the
bill,&mdash;which, for the credit of his cloth, I
believe he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="medium">CHIEFLY CULINARY.</span></h2>

<p>It was Frederick the Great, I believe, who
said that "An army, like a serpent, goes upon
its belly,"&mdash;which was but another way of
saying that if you want men to fight well, you
must feed them well.</p>

<p>Of provisions, Uncle Sam usually gave us a
sufficiency; but the table to which he invited
his boys was furnished with little variety and
less delicacy. On first entering the service,
the drawing of our rations was not a small undertaking,
for there were nearly a hundred of
us in the company, and it takes a considerable
weight of bread and pork to feed a hundred
hungry stomachs. But after we had been in
the field a year or two, the call, "Fall in for
your hard-tack!" was leisurely responded to
by only about a dozen men,&mdash;lean, sinewy,
hungry-looking fellows, each with his haversack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
in hand. I can see them yet as they sat
squatting around a gum-blanket spread on the
ground, on which were a small heap of sugar,
another of coffee, and another of rice, may be,
which the corporal was dealing out by successive
spoonfuls, as the boys held open their
little black bags to receive their portion, while
near by lay a small piece of salt pork or beef,
or possibly a dozen potatoes.</p>

<p>Much depended, of course, on the cooking
of the provisions furnished us. At first we
tried a company cook; but we soon learned
that the saying of Miles Standish,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i3h">        "If you wish a thing to be well done,</div>
<div class="line">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>applied to cooking quite as well as to courting.
We therefore soon dispensed with our
cook, and although scarcely any of us knew
how to cook so much as a cup of coffee when
we took the field, a keen appetite, aided by
that necessity which is ever the mother of invention,
soon taught us how bean-soup should
be made and hard-tack prepared.</p>

<p>Hard-tack! It is a question which I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
much debated with myself while writing,
whether this chapter should not be entitled
"Hard-Tack." For as this article of diet
was the grand staff of life to the Boys in Blue,
it would seem that but little could be said of
the culinary art in camp without involving
some mention of hard-tack at almost every
turn.</p>

<div><a name="fall_in_for_hard_tack" id="fall_in_for_hard_tack"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i292.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Fall in for Hard Tack!</span>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>As I write, there lies before me on my
table an innocent-looking cracker, which I
have faithfully preserved for years. It is
about the size and has the general appearance
of an ordinary soda biscuit. If you take it
in your hand, you will find it somewhat heavier
than an ordinary biscuit, and if you bite it&mdash;but
no; I will not let you bite it, for I wish
to see how long I can keep it. But if you were
to reduce it to a fine powder, you would find
that it would absorb considerably more water
than an equal weight of wheat-flour; showing
that in the making of hard-tack the chief
object in view is to stow away the greatest
amount of nourishment in the smallest amount
of space. You will also observe that this
cracker is very hard. This you may perhaps
attribute to its great age. But if you imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
that its age is to be measured only by the
years which have elapsed since the war, you
are greatly mistaken; for there was a common
belief among the boys that our hard-tack
had been baked long before the commencement
of the Christian era! This opinion was
based upon the fact that the letters B. C.
were stamped on many, if not indeed all, of
the cracker-boxes. To be sure there were
some wiseacres who shook their heads, and
maintained that these mysterious letters were
the initials of the name of some army contractor
or inspector of supplies; but the
belief was wide-spread and deep-seated that
they were without a doubt intended to set
forth the era in which our bread had been
baked.</p>

<p>For our hard-tack were very hard; you
could scarcely break them with your teeth&mdash;some
of them you could not fracture with
your fist. Still, as I have said, there was an
immense amount of nourishment stowed away
in them, as we soon discovered when once we
had learned the secret of getting at it. It
required some experience and no little hunger
to enable one to appreciate hard-tack aright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and it demanded no small amount of inventive
power to understand how to cook hard-tack
as they ought to be cooked. If I
remember correctly, in our section of the
army we had not less than fifteen different
ways of preparing them. In other parts, I
understand, they had discovered one or two
ways more; but with us, fifteen was the limit
of the culinary art when this article of diet
was on the board.</p>

<p>On the march they were usually not cooked
at all, but eaten in the raw state. In order,
however, to make them somewhat more palatable,
a thin slice of nice fat pork was cut down
and laid on the cracker, and a spoonful of
good brown sugar put on top of the pork, and
you had a dish fit for a&mdash;soldier. Of course
the pork had just come out of the pickle, and
was consequently quite raw; but fortunately
we never heard of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trichinæ</i> in those days. I
suppose they had not yet been invented.
When we halted for coffee, we sometimes had
fricasseed hard-tack&mdash;prepared by toasting
them before the hot coals, thus making them
soft and spongy. If there was time for frying,
we either dropped them into the fat in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
dry state and did them brown to a turn, or
soaked them in cold water and then fried
them, or pounded them into a powder, mixed
this with boiled rice or wheat flour, and made
griddle-cakes and honey&mdash;minus the honey.
When, as was generally the case on a march,
our hard-tack had been broken into small
pieces in our haversacks, we soaked these in
water and fried them in pork-fat, stirring
well and seasoning with salt and sutler's
pepper, thus making what was commonly
known as a "Hishy-hashy, or a hot-fired
stew."</p>

<p>But the great triumph of the culinary art
in camp, to my mind, was a hard-tack pudding.
This was made by placing the biscuit
in a stout canvas bag, and pounding bag and
contents with a club on a log, until the biscuit
were reduced to a fine powder. Then
you added a little wheat-flour (the more the
better), and made a stiff dough, which was
next rolled out on a cracker-box lid, like pie-crust.
Then you covered this all over with a
preparation of stewed dried apples, dropping
in here and there a raisin or two, just for
"auld lang syne's" sake. The whole was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
then rolled together, wrapped in a cloth,
boiled for an hour or so, and eaten with wine
sauce. The wine was, however, usually omitted,
and hunger inserted in its stead.</p>

<p>Thus you see what truly vast and unsuspected
possibilities reside in this innocent-looking
three-and-a-half-inch-square hard-tack
lying here on my table before me. Three
like this specimen made a meal, and nine
were a ration; and this is what fought the
battles for the Union.</p>

<p>The army hard-tack had but one rival, and
that was the army bean. A small white
roundish soup-bean it was, such as you have
no doubt often seen. It was quite as innocent
looking as its inseparable companion, the
hard-tack, and, like it, was possessed of possibilities
which the uninitiated would never suspect.
It was not so plastic an edible as the
hard-tack, indeed; that is to say, not capable
of entering into so many different combinations,
nor susceptible of so wide a range of
use, but the one great dish which might be
made of it was so pre-eminently excellent, that
it threw hishy-hashy and hard-tack pudding
quite into the shade. This was "baked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
beans." No doubt bean-soup was very good,
as it was also very common; but oh, "baked
beans!"</p>

<p>I had heard of the dish before, but had
never, even remotely, imagined what toothsome
delights lurked in the recesses of a
camp-kettle of beans baked after the orthodox
backwoods fashion, until one day Bill Strickland,
whose home was in the lumber regions,
where the dish had no doubt been first invented,
said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come round to our tent to-morrow morning;
we're going to have baked beans for
breakfast. If you will walk around to the
lower end of our Company street with me,
I'll show you how we bake beans up in the
country I come from."</p>

<p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon,
and the boys were already busy. They had
an immense camp-kettle about two thirds full
of parboiled beans. Near by they had dug a
hole in the ground, about three feet square
and two deep, in which and on top of which
a great fire was to be made about dusk, so as
to get the hole thoroughly heated and full
of red-hot coals by the time <em>tattoo</em> sounded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Into this hole the camp-kettle was then set,
with several pounds of fat pork on the top of
the beans, and securely covered with an inverted
mess-pan. It was sunk into the red-hot
coals, by which it was completely concealed,
and was left there all night to bake, one of
the camp-guards throwing a log on the fire
from time to time during the night, to keep
matters a-going.</p>

<p>Early the next morning some one shook me
roughly, as I lay sleeping soundly in my
bunk,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get up, Harry. Breakfast is ready.
Come over to our tent. If you never ate
baked beans before, you never ate anything
worth eating."</p>

<p>I found three or four of the boys seated
around the camp-kettle, each with a tin plate
on his knee and a spoon in his hand, doing
their very best to establish the truth of the
adage that "the proof of the pudding is in the
eating." Now it is a far more difficult matter
to describe the experiences of the palate
than of either the eye or the ear, and therefore
I shall not attempt to tell the reader how
very good baked beans are. The only trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
with a camp-kettle full of this delicious food
was that it was gone so soon. Where <em>did</em> it
get to, anyhow? It was something like Father
Tom's quart of drink,&mdash;"an irrational quantity,
because it was too much for one and too
little for two."</p>

<p>Still, too much of a good thing <em>is</em> too much;
and one might get quite too much of beans
(except in the state above described), as you
will find if you ask some friend or acquaintance
who was in the war to sing you the song
of "The Army Bean." And remember,
please, to ask him to sing the refrain to the
tune sometimes called "Days of Absence,"
and to pull up sharp on the last word,&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="medium">"HATCHER'S RUN."</span></h2>

<p>While we were yet before Petersburg, two
divisions of our corps (the Fifth), with two divisions
of the Ninth, leaving the line of works
at the Weldon Railroad, were pushed out still
farther to the left, with the intention of turning
the enemy's right flank.</p>

<p>Starting out, therefore, early on the morning
of Thursday, October 27, 1864, with four
days' rations in our haversacks, we moved off
rapidly by the left, striking the enemy's
picket-line about ten o'clock.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>"Pop! pop! pop! Boom! boom! boom!
We're in for it again, boys; so, steady on the
left there, and close up."</p>

<p>Away into the woods we plunge in line of
battle, through briers and tangled undergrowth,
beneath the great trees dripping with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
rain. We lose the points of the compass, and
halt every now and then to close up a gap in
the line by bearing off to the right or left.
Then forward we go through the brush again,
steady on the left and guide right, until I feel
certain that officers as well as men are getting
pretty well "into the woods" as to the direction
of our advance. It is raining, and we
have no sun to guide us, and the moss is
growing on the wrong side of the trees. I
see one of our generals sitting on his horse,
with his pocket-compass on the pommel of his
saddle, peering around into the interminable
tangle of brier and brush, with an expression
of no little perplexity.</p>

<p>Yet still on, boys, while the pickets are popping
away, and the rain is pouring down.
The evening falls early and cold, as we come
to a stand in line of battle and put up breastworks
for the night.</p>

<p>We have halted on the slope of a ravine.
Minié-balls are singing over our heads as we
cook our coffee, while sounds of axes and falling
trees are heard on all sides; and still that
merry "z-i-p! z-i-p!" goes on among the tree-tops
and sings us to sleep at length, as we lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
down shivering under our India-rubber blankets,
to get what rest we may.</p>

<p>How long we had slept I did not know,
when some one shook me, and in a whisper
the word passed around:</p>

<p>"Wake up, boys! Wake up, boys! Don't
make any noise, and take care your tin cups
and canteens don't rattle. We've got to get
out of this on a double jump!"</p>

<p>We were in a pretty fix indeed! In placing
the regiments in position, by some blunder,
quite excusable, no doubt, in the darkness and
the tangled forest, we had been unwittingly
pushed beyond the main line,&mdash;were, in fact,
quite outside the picket-line! It needed only
daylight to let the enemy see his game, and
sweep us off the boards. And daylight was
fast coming in the east.</p>

<p>Long after, a Company A boy, who was on
picket that night, told me that, upon going to
the rear somewhere about three o'clock, to
cook a cup of coffee at a half-extinguished fire,
a cavalry picket ordered him back within the
lines.</p>

<p>"The lines are not back there; my regiment
is out yonder in front, on skirmish!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
"No," said the cavalry-man, "our cavalry is
the extreme picket-line, and our orders are
to send in all men beyond us."</p>

<p>"Then take me at once to General Bragg's
headquarters," said the Company A boy.</p>

<p>When General Bragg learned the true state
of affairs, he at once ordered out an escort of
five hundred men to bring in our regiment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were trying to get back of
our own accord.</p>

<p>"This way, men!" said a voice in a whisper
ahead.</p>

<p>"This way, men!" said another voice in
the rear.</p>

<p>That we were wandering about vainly in
the darkness, and under no certain leadership,
was evident, for I noticed in the dim
light that, in our tramping about in the tangle,
we had twice crossed the same fallen tree,
and so must have been moving in a circle.</p>

<p>And now, as the day is dawning in the east,
and the enemy's pickets see us trying to steal
away, a large force is ordered against us, and
comes sweeping down with yells and whistling
bullets,&mdash;just as the escort of five hundred,
with reassuring cheers, comes up from the rear
to our support!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Instantly we are in the cloud and smoke of
battle. A battery of artillery, hastily dragged
up into position, opens on the charging line of
gray with grape and canister, while from bush
and tree pours back and forth the dreadful
blaze of musketry. For half an hour, the conflict
rages fierce and high in the dawning
light and under the dripping trees,&mdash;the officers
shouting, and the men cheering and yelling
and charging, often fighting hand to hand
and with bayonets locked in deadly encounter,
while the air is cut by the whistling lead,
and the deep bass of the cannon wakes the
echoes of the forest.</p>

<p>But at last the musketry-fire gradually
slackens, and we find ourselves out of danger.</p>

<p>The enemy's prey has escaped him, and, to
the wonder of all, we are brought within the
lines again, begrimed with smoke and leaving
many of our poor fellows dead or wounded
on the field.</p>

<p>Anxiously every man looked about for his
chum and messmates, lost sight of during
the whirling storm of battle in the twilight
woods. And I, too, looked; but where was
Andy?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="medium">KILLED, WOUNDED, OR MISSING?</span></h2>

<p>Andy was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>All along the line of battle-worn men, now
gathered in irregular groups behind the
breastworks, and safe from the enemy, I
searched for him&mdash;and searched in vain.
Not a soul had tidings of him. At last,
however, a soldier with his blouse-sleeve
ripped up and a red-stained bandage around
his arm, told me that, about daylight, when
the enemy came sweeping down on us, he
and Andy were behind neighboring trees.
He himself received a ball through the arm,
and was busy trying to stop the flow of blood,
when, looking up, he saw Andy reel, and, he
thought, <em>fall</em>. He was not quite sure it was
Andy, but he thought so.</p>

<p>Andy killed! What should I do without
Andy?&mdash;the best and truest friend, the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
companionable messmate, that a soldier ever
could hope to have! It could not be! I
would look farther for him.</p>

<p>Out, therefore, I went, over the breastworks
to the picket-line, where the rifles were
popping away at intervals. I searched among
trees and behind bushes, and called and
called, but all in vain. Then the retreat was
sounded, and we were drawn off the field,
and marched back to the fortifications which
we had left the day before.</p>

<p>Toward evening, as we reached camp, I
obtained permission to examine the ambulance-trains,
in search of my chum. As one
train after another came in, I climbed up and
looked into each ambulance; but the night
had long set in before I found him&mdash;or
thought I had found him. Raising my lantern
high, so as to throw the light full on the
face of the wounded man lying in a stupor
on the floor of the wagon, I was at first confident
it was Andy; for the figure was short,
well-built, and had raven black hair.</p>

<p>"Andy! Andy! Where are you hurt?"
I cried.</p>

<p>But no answer came. Rolling him on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
back and looking full into his face, I found,
alas! a stranger&mdash;a manly, noble face, too,
but no life, no signs of life, in it. There
were indeed a very low, almost imperceptible
breathing and a faint pulse&mdash;but the man
was evidently dying.</p>

<p>About a week afterward, having secured a
pass from corps headquarters, I started for
City Point to search the hospitals there for
my chum. The pass allowed me not only to
go through all the guards I might meet on
my way, but also to ride free to City Point
over the railroad&mdash;"General Grant's Railroad,"
we called it.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, this was a branch of
the road from City Point to Petersburg, tapping
it about midway between the two places,
and from that point following our lines closely
to the extreme left of our position. Never
was road more hastily built. So rapidly did
the work advance, that scarcely had we
learned such a road was planned, before one
evening the whistle of a locomotive was
heard down the line only a short distance to
our right. No grading was done. The ties
were simply laid on the top of the ground,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
the rails were nailed fast, and the rolling-stock
was put on without waiting for ballast;
and there the railroad was&mdash;up hill and
down dale, and "as crooked as a dog's hind
leg." At only one point had any cutting
been done, and that was where the road,
after climbing a hill, came within range of
the enemy's batteries. The first trains which
passed up and down afforded a fine mark and
were shelled vigorously, the enemy's aim becoming
with daily practice so exact that
nearly every train was hit somewhere. The
hill was then cut through, and the fire
avoided. It was a rough road, and the riding
was full of fearful jolts; but it saved
thousands of mules, and enabled General
Grant to hold his position during the winter
of the Petersburg siege.</p>

<p>I was obliged to make an early start, for
the train left General Warren's headquarters
about four o'clock in the morning. When I
reached the station, I found on the platform
a huge pile of boxes and barrels, nearly as
high as a house, which I was informed was
the Fifth Corps' share of a grand dinner
which the people of New York had just sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
down to the Army of the Potomac. Before
the train arrived I had seen enough to cause
me to fear that a very small portion of the
contents of those boxes and barrels would
ever find its way into the haversack of a
drummer-boy. For I had not been contemplating
the pile with a wistful eye very long,
before a certain sergeant came out of a
neighboring tent with a lantern in his hand,
followed by two darkies, one of whom carried
an axe.</p>

<p>"Knock open that bar'l, Bill," said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>Bill did so. The sergeant, thrusting in his
hand, pulled out a fat turkey and a roll of
butter.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he. "Now let's see what's
in that box."</p>

<p>Smash went Bill's axe into the side of the
box.</p>

<p>"Good again!" said the sergeant, taking
out a chicken, several tumblers of jelly, and
a great pound-cake, which latter made me
feel quite homesick. "Now, Bill," continued
the sergeant, "let's have breakfast."</p>

<p>City Point was a stirring place at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
time. It was General Grant's headquarters,
and the depot of all supplies for the army;
and here I found the large hospitals which
I meant to search for Andy, although I
scarcely hoped to find him.</p>

<p>Into hospital-tents at one end and out at
the other, looking from side to side at the
long white rows of cots, and inquiring as I
went, I searched long and almost despairingly,
until at last&mdash;there he was, sitting
on his cot, his head neatly bandaged, writing
a letter!</p>

<p>Coming up quietly behind him, I laid my
hand on his shoulder with: "Andy, old boy,
have I found you at last? I thought you
were killed!"</p>

<p>"Why, Harry!&mdash;God bless you!"</p>

<p>The story was soon told. "A clip in the
head, you see, Harry, out there among the
trees when the Johnnies came down on us,
yelling like demons,&mdash;all got black before
me as I reeled and fell. By and by, coming
to myself a little, I begged a man of a strange
regiment to help me off, and so I got down
here. It's nothing much, Harry, and I'll
soon be with you again,&mdash;not nearly so bad as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
that poor fellow over there, the man with
the black hair. His is a wonderful case. He
was brought in the same day I was, with a
wound in the head which the doctors said
was fatal. Every day we expected him to
die; but there he lies yet, breathing very low,
conscious, but unable to speak or to move
hand or foot. Some of his company came
yesterday to see him. They had been with
him when he fell, had supposed him mortally
wounded, and had taken all his valuables out
of his pockets to send home&mdash;among them
was an ambrotype of his wife and child.
Well, you just should have seen that poor
fellow's face when they opened that ambrotype
and held it before his eyes! He couldn't
speak or reach out his hand to take the picture;
and there he lay, convulsed with feeling,
while tears rolled down his cheeks."</p>

<p>On looking at him, I found it was the very
man I had seen in the ambulance and mistaken
for Andy.</p>

<p>Before returning to camp on the evening
train, I strolled along the wharf and watched
the boats coming and going, lading and unlading
their cargoes of army supplies. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
company of colored soldiers was doing guard
duty at one point along the wharf. They
were evidently proud of their uniforms, and
big with importance generally. By and by
two officers came leisurely walking toward
the wharf, one of whom I at once recognized
as General Grant. He was smoking a cigar.
As the two stood on the edge of the wharf,
looking up the river and conversing in low
tones, one of the colored guards came up
behind them and tapped the general on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Gen'l," said the guard, giving
the military salute, "but dere ain't no
smokin' allowed on dis yere warf."</p>

<p>"Are those your orders?" asked the general,
with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah; dem's de orders."</p>

<p>Promptly taking his cigar from his lips,
the general threw it into the water.</p>

<p>On my return to camp late in the evening,
I found that the comrade with whom I was
messing during Andy's absence had already
"turned in" for the night. Leaning upon
his elbow on his bunk, as I was stirring up
the fire, in order to make a cup of coffee, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
"There is your share of the dinner the New
York people sent down to the Army of the
Potomac."</p>

<p>"Where?" inquired I, looking around everywhere
in all the corners of the tent. "I don't
see it."</p>

<p>"Why, there on your knapsack in the
corner."</p>

<p>On looking toward the spot indicated, I
found one potato, half an onion, and the
gristly end of a chicken-wing!</p>

<p>"You see," continued my messmate, "the
New York people meant well, but they have
no idea how big a thing this Army of the
Potomac is, and they did not stop to consider
how many toll-gates their dinner would have
to pass in order to reach us. By the time
corps, division, brigade, regimental, and company
headquarters had successively inspected
and taken toll out of the boxes and barrels,
there was precious little left for the high
private in the rear rank."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="medium">A WINTER RAID TO NORTH CAROLINA.</span></h2>

<p>About the beginning of December, 1864,
we were busy building cabins for the winter.
Everywhere in the woods to our rear were
heard the sound of axes and the crash of falling
trees. Men were carrying pine-logs on
their shoulders, or dragging them along the
ground with ropes, for the purpose of building
our last winter-quarters; for of the three
years for which we had enlisted, but a few
months remained. The camp was a scene of
activity and interest on all sides. Here were
some men "notching" the logs to fit them
firmly together at the corners; yonder, one
was hewing rude Robinson Crusoe boards for
the eaves and gables; there, a man was digging
clay for the chimney, which his messmate
was cat-sticking up to a proper height;
while some had already stretched their shelters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
over rude cabins, and were busy cooking
their suppers. Just then, as ill-luck would
have it in those uncertain days, an orderly
rode into camp with some orders from headquarters,
and all building was directed to be
stopped at once.</p>

<p>"We have orders to move, Andy," said I,
coming into the half-finished cabin where
Andy (lately returned from hospital) was
chinking the cracks in the side of the house.</p>

<p>"Orders to move! Why, where in the
world are we going this time of year? I
thought we had tramped around enough for
one campaign, and were going to settle down
for the winter."</p>

<p>"I don't know where we're going; but
they say the Sixth Corps will relieve us in
the morning, and we are to pull out, anyhow."</p>

<p>We were not deceived. At daylight next
morning, December 6th, we did "pack up
and fall in" and move out from our fortified
camp, away to the rear, where we lay all day
massed in the woods, with nothing to do but to
speculate as to the direction we were to take.</p>

<p>From daylight of Wednesday, December
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
7th, we marched, through rain and stiff mud,
steadily toward the South, crossing the Nottaway
River on pontoons at 8 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, and
halting at midnight for such rest as we could
find on the cold damp soil of a cornfield.
Next day on again we went, straight toward
the South, through Sussex Court-house at 10
<span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, halting at dusk near the Weldon and
Petersburg Railway, about five miles from the
North Carolina line.</p>

<p>Though we did not then know what all this
meant, we soon learned that it was simply a
winter raid on the enemy's communications;
the intention being to destroy the Weldon
road, and so render it useless to him. True,
we had already cut that same road near Petersburg;
but the enemy still brought his supplies
on it from the South, near to the point
where our lines were thrown across, and by
means of wagons carried these supplies around
our left, and safely into Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrecking the Railway.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Never was railway more completely destroyed.
The morning after we had reached
the scene of operations, in the drizzling rain
and falling sleet, the whole command was set
to work. As far as the eye could see down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the road were men in blue, divested of weapons
and accoutrements, prying and wrenching
and tearing away at iron rails and
wooden ties. It was a well-built road, and
hard to tear up. The rails were what are
known as "T" rails, and each being securely
fastened to its neighbor at either end by a
stout bar of iron or steel, which had been
forced into the groove of the T, the track was
virtually two long unbroken rails throughout
its whole length.</p>

<p>"No use tryin' to tear up them rails from
the ties, Major," said an old railroader, with a
touch of his cap. "The plagued things are
all spliced together at the j'ints, and the only
way to get them off is to pry up the whole
thing, rails, ties, and all, and then split the
ties off from the rails when you've got her
upside down."</p>

<p>So, with fence-rails for levers, the men fell
to work, prying and heave-I-ho-ing, until one
side of the road, ties, track, and all, pulled
and wrenched by thousands of strong arms,
began to loosen and move, and was raised
gradually higher and higher. Forced at last
to a perpendicular, it was pushed over and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
laid upside down, with a mighty cheer from
the long line of wreckers!</p>

<p>Once the thing was started it was easy
enough to roll miles and miles of it over without
a break. And so brigade after brigade
rolled it along; tearing and splitting off the
ties, and wrenching away the rails.</p>

<p>It was not enough, however, merely to destroy
the track. The rails must be made forever
useless as rails. Accordingly, the ties
were piled in heaps, or built up as children
build corn-cob houses, and then the heaps
were fired. The rails were laid across the
top of the burning pile, where they soon became
red-hot in the middle, and bent themselves
double by the weight of their ends,
which hung out beyond the reach of the fire.
In some cases, however, a grim and humorous
conceit led to a more artistic use of the heated
rails, for many of them were taken and carried
to some tree hard by, and twisted two or
three times around the trunk, while not a few
of the men hit on the happy device of bending
the rails, some into the shape of a U, and
others into the shape of an S, and setting
them up by pairs against the fences along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
line, in order that, in this oft-repeated iron
U S, it might be seen that Uncle Sam had
been looking around in those parts.</p>

<p>When darkness came, the scene presented
by that long line of burning ties was wild and
weird. Rain and sleet had been falling all
day, and there was frost as well, and we lay
down at night with stiff limbs, aching bones,
and chattering teeth. Everything was covered
with a coating of ice; so that Andy and
I crept under a wagon for shelter and a dry
spot to lie down in. But the horses, tied to
the wheels, gave us little sleep. Scarcely
would we fall into a doze, when one of the
horses would poke his nose between the
wheels, or through the spokes, and whinny
pitifully in our ears. And no wonder, either,
we thought, when, crawling out at daybreak,
we found the poor creatures covered with a
coating of ice, and their tails turned to great
icicles. The trees looked very beautiful in
their magnificent frost-work; but we were too
cold and wet to admire anything, as our
drums hoarsely beat the "assembly," and we
set out for a two days' wet and weary march
back to camp in front of Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Both on the way down and on the retreat,
we passed many fine farms or plantations. It
was a new country to us, and no other Northern
troops had passed through it. One consequence
of this was that we were everywhere
looked upon with wonder by the white inhabitants,
and by the colored population as deliverers
sent for their express benefit.</p>

<p>All along the line of march, both down and
back, the overjoyed darkies flocked to us by
hundreds, old and young, sick and well, men,
women, and children. Whenever we came to
a road or lane leading to a plantation, a crowd
of darkies would be seen hurrying pell-mell
down the lane toward us. And then they
would take their places in the colored column
that already tramped along the road in awe
and wonderment beside "de sodjers." There
were stout young darkies with bundles slung
over their backs, old men hobbling along with
canes, women in best bib and tucker with immense
bundles on their heads, mothers with
babes in their arms, and a barefooted brood
trotting along at their heels; and now and
then one would call out anxiously to some
venturesome boy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
"Now, you Sam! Whar you goin' dar?
You done gone git run ober by de sodjers yit,
you will."</p>

<p>"Auntie, you've got a good many little
folks to look after, haven't you?" some kindly
soldier would say to one of the mothers.</p>

<p>"Ya-as, Cunnel, right smart o' chilluns I'se
got yere; but I'se a-gwine up Norf, an' can't
leabe enny on 'em behind, sah."</p>

<p>Fully persuaded that the year of jubilee had
come at last, the poor things joined us, from
every plantation along the road, many of them
mayhap leaving good masters for bad, and
comfortable homes for no homes at all. Occasionally,
however, we met some who would
not leave. I remember one old, gray-headed,
stoop-shouldered uncle who stood leaning over
a gate, looking wide-eyed at the blue-coats and
the great exodus of his people.</p>

<p>"Come along, uncle," shouted one of the
men. "Come along,&mdash;the year of jubilee is
come!"</p>

<p>"No, sah. Dis yere chile's too ole. Reckon
I better stay wid ole Mars'r."</p>

<p>When we halted at nightfall in a cotton-field,
around us was gathered a great throng of colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
people, houseless, homeless, well-nigh
dead with fatigue, and with nothing to eat.
Near where we pitched our tent, for instance,
was a poor negro woman with six little children,
of whom the oldest was apparently not
more than eight or nine years of age. The
whole forlorn family crouched shivering together
in the rain and sleet. Andy and I
thought, as we were driving in our tent-pins:</p>

<p>"That's pretty hard now, isn't it? Couldn't
we somehow get a shelter and something to
eat for the poor souls?"</p>

<p>It was not long before we had set up a rude
but serviceable shelter, and thrown in a blanket
and built a fire in front for them, and set
Dinah to cooking coffee and frying bacon for
her famishing brood.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget how comical those little
darkies looked as they sat cross-legged about
the fire, watching the frying-pan and coffee-pot
with great eager eyes!</p>

<p>Dinah, as she cooked, and poked the fire betimes,
told Andy and me how she had deserted
the old home at the plantation,&mdash;a home
which no doubt she afterward wished she had
never left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
"When we heerd dat de Yankees was
a-comin'," said she, "de folks all git ready
fer to leabe. Ole Mars' John, he ride out de
road dis way, an' young Mars' Harry, he ride
out de road dat way, fer to watch if dey was
a-comin'; and den ebbery now an' den one or
udder on 'em'd come a-ridin' up to de house
an' say, 'Did ye see anyt'ing on 'em yit?
Did ye hear whar dey is now?' An' den one
mawning, down come young Mars' Harry
a-ridin' his hoss at a gallop,&mdash;'Git out o' dis!
Git out o' dis! De Yankees is a-comin'!
De Yankees is a-comin'!' and den all de
folks done gone cl'ar out an' leabe us all
'lone, an' so when we see de sodjers comin'
we done cl'ar out too,&mdash;ki-yi!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="medium">"JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME."</span></h2>

<p>We had just come out of what is known as
the "Second Hatcher's Run" fight, somewhere
about the middle of February, 1865.
The company, which was now reduced to a
mere handful of men, was standing about a
smoking fire in the woods, discussing the
engagement and relating adventures, when
some one came in from brigade headquarters,
shouting the following message: "Say, boys,
good news! They told me over at headquarters
that we are to be sent North to relieve
the 'regulars' somewhere."</p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! That was an old story,&mdash;too
old to be good, and too good to be true.
For a year and more we had been hearing that
same good news,&mdash;"Going to Baltimore,"
"Going to Washington," and so forth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
we always ended with going into battle instead,
or off on some long raid.</p>

<p>So we didn't much heed the tidings; we
were too old birds to be caught with chaff.</p>

<p>But, in spite of our incredulity, the next
morning we were marched down to General
Grant's branch of the Petersburg Railway,
loaded on box-cars, and carried to City Point,
where we at once embarked on two huge
steamers, which we found awaiting us.</p>

<p>For two days and nights we were cooped up
in those miserable boats. We had no fire,
and we suffered from the cold. We had no
water for thirty-six hours, and, of course, no
coffee; and what is life to a soldier without
coffee? All were sea-sick, too, for the weather
was rough. And so, what with hunger and
thirst, cold and sea-sickness, we landed one
evening at Baltimore more dead than alive.</p>

<p>No sooner were we well down the gangplank
than the crowd of apple and pie women
that stood on the wharf made quick sales and
large profits. Then we marched away to a
"soldiers' retreat" and were fed. Fed!
We never tasted so grand a supper as that
before or since&mdash;"salt horse," dry bread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
and coffee! The darkies that carried around
the great cans of the latter were kept pretty
busy for a while, I can tell you; and they
must have thought:</p>

<p>"Dem sodjers, dar, must be done gone
starved, dat's sartin. Nebber seed sech hungry
men in all my bawn days,&mdash;nebber!"</p>

<p>After supper we were lodged in a great
upper room of a large building, having bunks
ranged around the four sides of it, and in the
middle an open space, which was soon turned
to account; for one of the boys strung up his
fiddle, which he had carried on his knapsack
for full two years, on every march and through
every battle we had been in, and with the help
of this we proceeded to celebrate our late
"change of front" with music and dancing
until the small hours of the morning.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">The Charge on the Cakes.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Down through the streets of Baltimore we
march the next day, with our blackened and
tattered flags a-flying, mustering only one
hundred and eighty men out of the one thousand
who marched through those same streets
nearly three years before. We find a train of
cars awaiting us, which we gladly enter, making
no complaint that we are stowed away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
in box or cattle cars, instead of passenger
coaches, for we understand that Uncle Sam
cannot afford any luxuries for his boys, and
we have been used to roughing it. Nor do
we complain, either, that we have no fire,
although we have just come out of a warm climate,
and the snow is a foot deep at Baltimore,
and is getting deeper every hour as we
steam away northward. Toward evening we
pass Harrisburg, giving "three cheers for
Andy Curtin," as the State Capitol comes in
sight. Night draws on, and the boys one by
one begin to bunk down on the floor, wrapped
in their great-coats and blankets. But I cannot
lie down or sleep until we have passed a
certain way-station, from which it is but two
miles across the hills to my home. I stand
at the door of the car, shivering and chilled
to the bone, patiently waiting and watching
as village after village rushes by in the bright
moonlight, until at long last we reach the well-known
little station at the hour of midnight.
And then, as I look across the snow-clad
moonlit hills, toward the old red farmhouse
where father and mother and sisters
are all sleeping soundly, with never a thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of my being so near, I fall to thinking, and
wondering, and wishing with a bounding
heart, as the train dashes on between the
mountain and the river, and bears me again
farther and farther away from home. Then
rolling myself up in my blanket, and drawing
the cape of my overcoat about my head, I lie
down on the car floor beside Andy, and am
soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>The following evening we landed at Elmira,
New York, where we were at once put on
garrison duty. <em>Why</em> we had been taken out
of the field and sent to a distant Northern
city, we never could discover, and we had
seen too much service to think of asking
questions which the mysterious pigeon-holes
of the War Department alone could answer.
But we always deemed it a pity that we were
not left in the field until the great civil war
came to an end with the surrender of Lee at
Appomattox, and that we had no part in the
final gathering of the troops at Washington,
where the grand old Army of the Potomac
passed in review for the last time.</p>

<p>But so it was, that after some months of monotonous
garrison duty at Elmira, the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and good news came at last one day that
peace had been declared, and that the great
war was over! My young readers can scarcely
imagine what joy instantly burst forth all over
the land. Bells were rung all day long, bonfires
burned, and people paraded the streets
half the night, and everybody was glad beyond
possibility of expression. And among the joyful
thousands all over the land, the Boys in
Blue were probably the gladdest of all; for
was not the war over now, and would not
"Johnny come marching home?"</p>

<p>But before we could go home we must be
mustered out, and then we must return to our
State capital to be paid off and finally disbanded,
and say a last good-by to our comrades
in arms, the great majority of whom
we should never in all probability see again.
And a more hearty, rough and ready, affectionate
good-by there never was in all this
wide world. In the rooms of one of the hotels
at the State capital we were gathered, waiting
for our respective trains: knapsacks slung,
Sharp's rifles at a "right-shoulder shift" or
a "carry;" songs were sung, hands shaken,
or rather wrung; loud, hearty "God bless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
you, old fellows!" resounded; and many were
the toasts and the healths that were drunk
before the men parted for good and all.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the last camp-fire
of the One Hundred and Fiftieth broke
up. "Good by, boys! Good by! God bless
you, old fellow!" was shouted again and
again, as by companies or in little squads we
were off for our several trains, some of us
bound North, some East, some West,&mdash;and
all bound for Home!</p>

<p>Of the thirteen men who had gone out
from our little village (whither my father's
family had meanwhile removed), but three
had lived to return home together. One had
already gone home the day before. Some
had been discharged because of sickness or
wounds, and four had been killed. As we
rode along over the dusty turnpike from
L&mdash;&mdash; to M&mdash;&mdash; in the rattling old stage-coach
that evening in June, we could not
help thinking how painful it would be for the
friends of Joe Gutelius and Jimmy Lucas
and Joe Ruhl and John Diehl to see us
return without their brave boys, whom we
had left on the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<div><a name="the_welcome_home" id="the_welcome_home"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i330.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">The Welcome Home.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Reaching the village at dusk, we found
gathered at the hotel where the stage stopped,
a great crowd of our school-fellows and
friends, who had come to meet us. We almost
feared to step down among them, lest
they should quite tear us to pieces with shaking
of hands. The stage had scarcely stopped
when I heard a well-known voice calling:</p>

<p>"Harry! Are <em>you</em> there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father! Here I am!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, my boy!"</p>

<p>And pushing his way through the crowd,
my father plunges into the stage, not able to
wait until it has driven around to the house;
and if his voice is husky with emotion, as he
often repeats "God bless you, my boy!" and
gets his arm around my neck, is it any
wonder?</p>

<p>But my dog Rollo can't get into the stage,
and so he runs barking after it, and is the
first to greet me at the gate, and jumps up at
me with his great paws on my shoulders.
Does he know me? I rather think he does!</p>

<p>Then mother and sisters come around, and
they must needs call for a lamp and hold it
close to my face, and look me all over from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
head to foot, while father is saying to himself
again and again, "God bless you, my boy!"</p>

<p>Although I knew that my name was never
forgotten in the evening prayer all the while
I was away, yet not once, perhaps, in all that
time was father's voice so choked in utterance
as when now, his heart overflowing,
he came to give thanks for my safe return.
And when I lay down that night in a clean
white bed, for the first time in three long
years, I thanked God for Peace and Home.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>And&mdash;Andy? Why&mdash;the Lord bless him
and his!&mdash;he's a soldier still. For, having
laid aside the blue, he put on the black, being
a sober, steady-going Presbyterian parson
now, somewhere up in York State. I haven't
seen him for years; but when we do meet,
once in a great while, there is such a wringing
of hands as makes us both wince until the
tears start, and we sit up talking over old
times so far into the night that the good folk
of the house wonder whether we shall ever
get to&mdash;</p>
